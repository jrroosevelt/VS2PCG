# Welcome to VS 2PCG!
You picked the sweetest game in the multiverse. Well done!

This FAQ is intended to answer some of the most common questions that new players ask. If you have a question, start here first!

## Which set should I start with? 
There's no right answer here, but here are a few common pieces of advice:
- As of July 2021, the Civil War Battles set is touted as, "The Best Place in the Multiverse to Learn How to Play Vs. System 2PCG!” 
	- This is a good place to start because most cards focus on more straightforward, easy-to-understand powers and abilities, but the cards are of comparable power level to some of the latter releases.
- The original base box.
	- This was the starting point for a number of players and still has a number of staple cards. 
	- However, new player should know that there has been a fair amount of power creep since this set was originally introduced, so some of the cards just don't stack up well any more.
- Who's your favorite character? Pick a set that includes them and start there!
	- You can use one of the community-run card browsers to figure out which set your character is in:
		- [Pocket VS](https://pocketvs.web.app/#/)
		- [TCG Browser](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/)
