# Welcome to VS 2PCG!
You picked the sweetest game in the multiverse. Well done!

This FAQ is intended to answer some of the most common questions that new players ask. If you have a question, start here first!

## Where can I find more humans who play this game?
One of the best things about VS 2PCG is that the community is tremendous. There are four main online communities that deal with VS. There's a lot of crossover between the groups, but it's nice to be plugged into all of them to get each of their strengths:

 - [VS 2PCG Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/)
	 - Almost seems silly to mention it since you're here already, but...
 - [VS 2PCG Collective on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/860168987351982)
	 - Community-run Facebook group
 - [VS System Illuminati on Discord](https://discord.gg/yDB9MDfm)
	 - Community-run Discord server
	 - Probably the best place to find an ad-hoc online game
 - [Upper Deck official Discord](https://discord.gg/uHMaBXWD)
	 - Least active of the communities, but...
	 - Is the best place to hear official announcements from Upper Deck
 

## Which set should I start with? 
There's no right answer here, but here are a few common pieces of advice:
- As of July 2021, the Civil War Battles set is touted as, "The Best Place in the Multiverse to Learn How to Play Vs. System 2PCG!” 
	- This is a good place to start because most cards focus on more straightforward, easy-to-understand powers and abilities, but the cards are of comparable power level to some of the latter releases.
- The original base box.
	- This was the starting point for a number of players and still has a number of staple cards. 
	- However, new player should know that there has been a fair amount of power creep since this set was originally introduced, so some of the cards just don't stack up well any more.
- Who's your favorite character? Pick a set that includes them and start there!
	- You can use one of the community-run card browsers to figure out which set your character is in:
		- [Pocket VS](https://pocketvs.web.app/#/)
		- [TCG Browser](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/)

## What set should I buy next? 
Once you've played a game or two and you see what a rad game VS can be, you're likely to wonder which sets you should buy next. [This handy-dandy flow chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/vs2pcg/wiki/whatsetnext) helps to show which boxes build on preceding boxes. 

## Are the rules somewhere online?
**Good news** - Yes, you can find the [official rule book online](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1nF6Wh6sNSTgopLu9-3p4P58LSq-pC-bxInOnBTvhRwc/mobilebasic)

**Bad news** - The rule book hasn't been updated for three years, so there are some missing pieces or some items out of date. Upper Deck has said that they are currently updating a comprehensive rules resource.

**More good news** - This wiki is a great spot for clarifications. Check out the following resources for more information about rules and card clarifications:
- [Glossary of common keyword powers and game terms](http://www.reddit.com/r/vs2pcg/wiki/glossary)
- [Major rulings, errata, bans, and misprints](https://www.reddit.com/r/vs2pcg/wiki/rulings)
- [Individual card rulings, FAQs, and rule insert notes](http://www.reddit.com/r/vs2pcg/wiki/rules-insert)

## How does combat work? I'm confused by ![](%%Range%%) and ![](%%Flight%%) 
If you've already looked at the [official rule book online](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1nF6Wh6sNSTgopLu9-3p4P58LSq-pC-bxInOnBTvhRwc/mobilebasic) and are still confused by some aspects of combat, don't feel bad. Many of us were (or still are?) right there with you. Here are a few notes that will hopefully help:

### Combat scenarios diagram
If you want to jump right to the gory details, check out [this diagram that shows many of the most common attack and defense scenarios](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jf0-omCPcbpdqMTpQDRgiqGoCMIGVphS/view?usp=sharing). 

### The most basic first... front row to front row
At the most basic, a character in your front row can attack an enemy character in their front row. If there's a face-up front-row character, any characters in the back row are considered to be **Protected**.

### What if my opponent has no front row?
If the enemy has no face-up front row characters, then you can attack their back row (the back-row characters are no longer **Protected**. Make sense? Ok, now we'll layer on a bit...

### How ![](%%Range%%) and ![](%%Flight%%) come into play

#### ![](%%Range%%)  (Range) indicates where you can attack FROM
If your character has the ![](%%Range%%) icon on their card, not only can they attack *from* your front row, but they can also attack *from* your back row. Generally, the previous rules still apply (they can only attack to the enemy's front row unless they have no face-up front-row characters).

####  ![](%%Flight%%)  (Flight) indicates where you can attack TO
If y
