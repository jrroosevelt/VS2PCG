# Welcome to VS 2PCG!
You picked the sweetest game in the multiverse. Well done!

This FAQ is intended to answer some of the most common questions that new players ask. If you have a question, start here first!

## Where can I find more humans who play this game?
One of the best things about VS 2PCG is that the community is tremendous. There are four main online communities that deal with VS. There's a lot of crossover between the groups, but it's nice to be plugged into all of them to get each of their strengths:

 - **[VS 2PCG Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/)**
	 - Almost seems silly to mention it since you're here already, but...
	 - It's a good spot to ask questions and the wiki is a tremendous source of info.
 - [VS 2PCG Collective on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/860168987351982)

## Which set should I start with? 
There's no right answer here, but here are a few common pieces of advice:
- As of July 2021, the Civil War Battles set is touted as, "The Best Place in the Multiverse to Learn How to Play Vs. System 2PCG!” 
	- This is a good place to start because most cards focus on more straightforward, easy-to-understand powers and abilities, but the cards are of comparable power level to some of the latter releases.
- The original base box.
	- This was the starting point for a number of players and still has a number of staple cards. 
	- However, new player should know that there has been a fair amount of power creep since this set was originally introduced, so some of the cards just don't stack up well any more.
- Who's your favorite character? Pick a set that includes them and start there!
	- You can use one of the community-run card browsers to figure out which set your character is in:
		- [Pocket VS](https://pocketvs.web.app/#/)
		- [TCG Browser](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/)

## What set should I buy next? 
Once you've played a game or two and you see what a rad game VS can be, you're likely to wonder which sets you should buy next. [This handy-dandy flow chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/vs2pcg/wiki/whatsetnext) helps to show which boxes build on preceding boxes. 

## Are the rules somewhere online?
**Good news** - Yes, you can find the [official rule book online](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1nF6Wh6sNSTgopLu9-3p4P58LSq-pC-bxInOnBTvhRwc/mobilebasic)

**Bad news** - The rule book hasn't been updated for three years, so there are some missing pieces or some items out of date.

**More good news** - This wiki is a great spot for clarifications. Check out the following resources for more information about rules and card clarifications:
- [Glossary of common keyword powers and game terms](http://www.reddit.com/r/vs2pcg/wiki/glossary)
