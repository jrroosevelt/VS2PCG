## Event Schedule

I'll do my best to keep this table up to date.  Feel free to let me know of any other events that may not be on the table.  No need to keep this limited to official UDE events in my opinion.

# Formats

## Basic Formats

### Multiverse Format (aka Standard Format)

This is the name for the default format of the game.  It includes all sets but still follows the [Split Universe rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/how-to-play#wiki_split_universe), disallowing Photographic Universe cards and Illustrated Universe cards to be in the same deck.

### Secret Wars Format

This is the name for the open format.  All sets are included and photographic/illustrated cards can be in the same deck.

### Loyalty Format

All cards with an affiliation in the deck (including MCs) must share an affiliation.  Non-affiliated characters cannot be included in a Loyal deck but dual affiliated characters are permitted provided one of their affiliations is shared with the rest of the deck.

## Featured Formats (listed most recent/future to oldest)

Any official UDE events will use the active featured format detailed below.  Take a look at the linked "relevant sets" to see the contents of the sets.  The Base set is still a recommended purchase since Basic Locations are not included in the small 55 card monthly sets and Wild Locations only appear in the set where the team was introduced.  Generic cards are allowed in all formats since the restrictions are by team.  This includes Kobik SC and Spider-Friends set's Black Cat SC as well as all the "MARVEL" affiliated cards that are in the format's universe.

###Battles Royale

Choose your 200-card set and build a deck from the cards inside!

**Season:** Winter 2021

**Active**: January 1st  2021 through March 31st  2021

-   S.H.I.E.L.D. Vs. Hydra
-   The MCU Battles
-   The Utopia Battles
-   The Fantastic Battles

Note: The  _only_ 200-card set not legal for this format is Vs. System 2PCG: Legacy.  **ALL other 200-card sets are legal.**  Also, in the event a set has a card that has been replaced (i.e. Singularity from A-Force) then the updated version must be used.

###The Alpha and the Omega

The mutants and their enemies are back and better than ever!

**Season**: Fall 2020

**Active**: October 1st 2020 through December 31st 2020
