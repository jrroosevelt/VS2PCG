# Names in VS2PCG
You'd think that the name of a card would be a pretty simple concept. But names can get fairly complex in VS 2PCG. Hopefully, this article will help you understand all the ins-and-outs of Names in VS.

# What identifies a card's name?
Card names can appear in two places:
* The card title (on top of the card)
* An "AKA" line (usually the top line of the card text box)

[Diagram showing Title vs. AKA location](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lxtnMZxxan0GyS7gRKNcKRsZoPbJGUX-/view?usp=drive_link)

The AKA line currently applies only to character cards. For Plot Twists, Equipment, Locations (etc.), the Card Title is always the card name.

## AKA (Also Known As)
The AKA line indicates any additional names that this card has in addition to its title. If a card has an AKA line, the "Card Name" is the card title and any names in AKA. So, in the above example, the card titled, "Paste-Pot Pete" has both the names "Paste-Pot Pete" and "Trapster".

## The importance of "Card Title"
In most cases, there's no practical significance between card title and AKAs. However, some card abilities or effects specifically reference "Card Title". For example, Ardina (HER-008) specifically requires a card with the *title* of Silver Surfer. So if there was a card with a different title but with "AKA Silver Surfer", that card could not be used to satisfy Ardina's ability.

# Mantles
Some characters have donned the same name as another character. For example, Miles Morales and Peter Parker are both "Spider-Man" in the comics, shows, and movies.

To differentiate one character from another in VS, their names are shown differently. The character who later picked up the mantle has their name designated with asterisks. So, in VS 2PCG, you'd see their names listed like this:
* Peter Parker = Spider-Man
* Miles Morales = \*Spider-Man\*

In some cases, yet another character has the mantle, and they'll have double asterisks. (For example, \*\*Spider-Man\*\*.)

## Mantles are not the same name!
When you say the card names out loud, they sound the same - but "Spider-Man" and "\*Spider-Man\*" are *not* the same name. 

**Pro-tip:** To clear up any confusion, I like to actually append "Mantle" when saying the name of the card out loud. So if I needed to name Miles Morales' \*Spider-Man\* in VS, I would actually say, "Mantle Spider-Man".

# Naming across Intellectual Properties (IPs) and Universes

## Mantles across different IPs
VS pulls in characters from different intellectual properties, such as Marvel and Aliens. In some cases, there are characters with the same name across those IPs. For example, the X-Men in Marvel have a Bishop, as does the Company team in the Aliens set (20th Century Fox). Also, we could see more such as Spider-Man's nemesis Scorpion as opposed to Scorpion from Mortal Kombat.

There was a specific ruling to indicate that mantles do not cross Intellectual Properties. This resulted in an [errata to an early "Bishop" card](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rulings/#wiki_mantles_can_no_longer_cross_intellectual_properties).

## Names across Universes
### Uniqueness and Power-Ups
In addition to different IPs, VS of course has the Photographic and Illustrated universes. When crossing universes, characters with the same name are considered different for the purposes of uniqueness and power-ups. For example, if I'm playing the Uatu Main Character, I can mix photo and illustrated cards in my deck. The above rule would allow me to play an illustrated "Spider-Man" at the same time that I play a photographic "Spider-Man". However, I could not power up the photo version with the illustrated version, or vice-versa.

### Naming a card or naming for powers/abilities
However, when you are required to "Name a card" (or "Name a character"), saying that name will apply to cards with that name regardless of whether they're in the photographic or illustrated universe. Similarly, if an ability calls out a character name, that will apply both to photographic or illustrated versions with that name.

For example, the photo "May Parker" card (MCU7-007) states:
> While a Spider-Man character is protecting May, he has +3/+3.

This would apply both to photographic or illustrated cards named "Spider-Man"
