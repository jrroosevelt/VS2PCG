# Rule insert card clarifications
The following clarifications are included in the rule inserts that come with the various sets. 

**Note**: There have been some minor editorial liberties taken (not all are exact quotations from the main source). These changes are mainly cosmetic or made to help understand context outside of the rulesheet and do not fundamentally change the intent of the original text.

For additional information, see also:

## Abomination
Set: MCU Battles
**Give Me a Real Fight!**
Abomination’s **Give Me a Real Fight!** Power forces a player’s first attack to include a specific character and the defender must be Abomination. However if either that character can’t attack or Abomination can’t be attacked, the effect does nothing. Also, the player can choose not to attack at all on their turn.

## Agents
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra
Several (S.H.I.E.L.D.)  characters have the new Agent Keyword Power, which allows them to work together as a spy network. When an Agent appears, look at cards from the top of your deck equal the number of **Agents** on your side. Put any of them on the bottom of your deck. The more Agents you have, the better you’ll be at gathering intel. 

## Ajax
Set: Deadpool & Friends
**Pain Tolerance**
Ajax's **Pain Tolerance** power says he can only be KO'd by fatal wounds at the end of a turn. A character has fatal wounds if it has at least as many wounds as its health. So Ajax can have any amount of wounds but won't actually get KO'd until the end of a turn.

## Alcatraz
**It's a Prison**
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.
When the character in “prison” turns face up, the player who used Alcatraz decides which row on its original side it goes back to.

## Arnim Zola (MC)
Set: Crossover
**ESP Box**
ESP Box takes effect once the game starts and lasts the whole game (even while Arnim Zola is stunned, after he levels up, and even after he is KO’d). You can play any Equipment as a Supporting Character, regardless of whether you have a character with a matching team affiliation. When you play one as a Supporting Character, it’s no longer an Equipment. If it has a power that references “Equipped Character,” it is its own equipped character. When the card leaves play it will go back to being an Equipment. You may still play an Equipment normally and equip it to one of your characters (including on an Equipment that you played as a Supporting Character). 

**A New Robot Body**
When Arnim Zola enters A New Robot Body, your new Equipment-turned-Main Character will have ATK/DEF equal to its cost, 1 (Health), Swarm, and it will count as its own “Equipped Character,” just like with ESP Box. When that body gets KO’d, it can use this power again to jump into another robot body, and so on. Note: if you want to use a Wild Special Location to pay for this power, it must match the team affiliation of the Main Character using this power.



## Avalanche
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants
**Sustained Seismic Waves**
Avalanche’s Sustained Seismic Waves power gets stronger each time he uses it. However, if you play a new copy of Avalanche later, the super power on that copy will start over.

## Baron Mordo (MC)
Set: Legacy
**Hypnotize**
Baron Mordo can revert a main character back to level 1 until your next turn. When the effect wears off, the character goes back to whatever level and card it was before.

## * Bishop *
Set: Legacy
**Energy Transference**
This power refers to (Energy/Atom) super powers.This counts for any super power with the appropriatesymbol in its cost (even if it also has other symbols in
its cost).

## Black Bolt
Set: Monsters Unleashed!
Black Bolt’s Super Powers use the Amplify ability.When you use a Super Power, if you discard aLocation (instead of turning it face-down in yourresource row), you get the Amplify text. PreviousAmplify Super Powers grant an effect to begin with
but a larger effect if you Amplify it. Black Bolt’spowers only grant an effect if you Amplify them.

## Black Panther (MC)
Set: MCU Heroes
**Vibranium Weave Suit**
Black Panther Black Panther’s **Vibranium Weave Suit** power prevents him from being struck for the entire turn including the combat he’s currently in.

## Black Panther (SC)
Set: MCU Heroes
**Bulletproof**
Black Panther Black Panther’s **Bulletproof** power prevents enemy characters with [Range] from striking him. It doesn’t matter if Black Panther is attacking or defending, or if it’s a melee attack or ranged attack. As long as a character has [Range] it can’t strike him.

## Blob (MC)
Set: Crossover
**Boing**
If Blob strikes a character and his Boing! power causes that character to strike itself, you add Blob’s ATK to that character’s own ATK to see if it’s enough to stun it. 

**Immovable Object**
If Blob moves for any reason (including during your Formation Step or because another effect moves him), he will be prevented from gaining an XP. At the end of Blob’s first turn of the game, he will gain an XP if he didn’t move that turn.

## Blob (SC)
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants
**Stuck in His Stomach**
Blob’s Stuck in His Stomach power represents a melee attacker getting temporarily trapped by Blob’s flab. This effect will take place even if Blob gets KO’d in the attack. (Just imagine him unconscious lying on top of the attacker.)
 
**Bounced Off His Belly**
And his Bounced Off His Belly power represents projectiles getting bounced back at any ranged attackers. Note: In the event that Blob somehow had (Range) he would not strike back using his own ATK because Bounced Off His Belly’s strike back would override his normal strike back.

## Break the Fourth Wall
Set: Deadpool & Friends
This plot twist really lets you get in the game. When you put a “Me” token onto your side, you get to choose a team affiliation and your age will determine your ATK and DEF. You’ll have Leader because you’re still in charge of your team, but don’t worry – if you get KO’d you don’t lose the game because you’re also still a player. We figure you have more questions about all this, so let’s dive in. 

* **How do you prove your age?** If you’re at a tournament you’ll need an ID with a birthday. If you don’t have one, we’ll just pretend you’re 11.  

* **Does this card have different power levels for different players depending on their age?** Yes.  

* **Isn’t that ageist?** Great question. Think about it this way: Yes.  

* **What happens if I’m 29 and tomorrow’s my birthday, but then it turns to midnight in the middle of the game?** You’ll become a 3/0 and get stunned.  

* **Isn’t that kind of stupid?** Play faster next time.

* **I feel like you’re not taking this seriously.** That’s not a question.

## Bruce Banner (and the Hulk) (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
Bruce doesn’t level up. Instead, when he attacks he transforms right into the Hulk Level 2 main character. Note: Hulk doesn’t have a Level 1 version. The only way to become him is to start as Bruce.

## Bullseye (MC)
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.
**Perfect Aim**
When Bullseye uses **Perfect Aim** it will give him ATK until it’s equal to the defender’s DEF. But if the Defender gains or loses DEF later in the combat, that won’t affect Bullseye’s ATK.
**Everything’s a Weapon**
With **Everything’s a Weapon**, you’ll put the top card of your deck into your KO pile before you choose which enemy character to apply the effect to.

## Chimichanga
Set: Deadpool & Friends
Deadpool’s favorite deep-fried burrito has two different costs to use its super power. You must choose which cost to pay – you can’t combine them. For example, you couldn’t pay **(Energy)** and **(Intellect)** and then say Chimichanga twice. That would be madness.


## Daken
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants
**Pheromone Control**
Daken’s **Pheromone Control** power takes away enemy characters’ powers while they’re in melee combat with him. This will prevent triggered powers like **Shrink** or **Berserker** from triggering in the first place.

## Devil Dinosaur
Set: Monsters Unleashed!
Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur each have two differentteam affiliations. Moon Girl is on the Inhumans andDevil Dinosaur is on the Monsters Unleashed team.But both of them are also on the Moon Girl/DevilDinosaur team. This allows them to Team Attacktogether or with members of their respective teams.(Keep in mind all members of a Team Attack mustshare at least one team affiliation.)

**Devil Dinosaur and Moon Girl** (MCs)
The Main Characters, Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur,go together. You start with both on your side andyou’re only out of the game once both are KO’d.

## Dormammu
Set: MCU Villains
**You Will Spend Eternity Dying**
Dormammu’s **You Will Spend Eternity Dying** power allows you to wound a Main Character as many times as you’d like. For example, you could wound them twice. Or six times. Or three hundred times. Just don’t make any bargains with them.

## Dark Phoenix (SC)
Set: Crossover
**Deconstruct the Universe**
Dark Phoenix When Dark Phoenix Deconstructs the Universe, an entire concept of the game gets removed for the rest of the game (even if she leaves play). If, as a result of this, the wording of a card’s power is unclear, the part that is unclear does nothing. Here’s how removing each concept works: 

* **+1/+1 and -1/-1 counters:** Remove all of those counters from the game. Remove the phrases “+1/+1 counter” and “-1/-1 counter” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause these counters to enter the game in any way 
 
* **Equipment**: Remove all Equipment cards everywhere from the game. This includes all sides, decks, hands, KO piles, and Equipment that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Equipment cards but don’t currently count as Equipment (such as a face-down resource or an Equipment that has become a character via Arnim Zola’s   
**ESP Box**). Remove the term “Equipment” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Equipment to enter the game in any way.  

* **Keyword text:** Removing this concept doesn’t affect **Flight** and **Range**. Remove all Keyword text from the game, including powers that “can’t be turned off”. Remove the term “Keyword” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Keyword text to enter the game in any way.  
 
* **Levels:** All Main Characters everywhere become Level 1 if possible. Remove all remaining Level 2 and higher Main Characters from the game. Remove all Level Up Powers and XP from the game, and the terms “Level” and “XP” from all card text. Ignore any effects that would cause XP or a Level 2 or higher Main Character to enter the game in any way.  

* **Plot Twists:** Remove all Plot Twist cards everywhere from the game. This includes all decks, hands, KO piles, and Plot Twists that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Plot Twist cards but are not currently Plot Twists (such as a face-down resource). Remove the term “Plot Twist” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause a Plot Twist to enter the game in any way.  

* **Super Powers:** Remove all Super Powers from the game. Remove the term “Super Power” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Super Powers to enter the game in any way.  



## Deadpool (MC)
Set: Deadpool & Friends  
> Hiya kids, it’s your old pal, Deadpool. Guess what? I’m the First character in the game to go all the way to Level 4. There’s probably a break-the-fourth-wall joke in there somewhere, but I haven’t found it yet. Anyhoo, the powers that be want me to tell you that even though I’m now on two different main character cards, the (X-Men) and (Underworld) versions of me can’t level up into each other.  
> 
> It’s because a main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork. And guess what? I don’t mean to brag but I’m actually a designer now. You know all the cards in this set that you love? That’s right -- I designed them. (All the cards that you hate were designed by those other two dummies.) Designing stuff is sweet. You can pretty much do whatever you want.  
> 
> I like designing so much, I wanted to do some while I was in the game too. My new main character can **nerf** stuff, **errata** stuff, and even **ban** stuff. Check it out:  

**I'm Taking Over From These Idiot Designers**  
  
* **Nerf:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks, and KO piles are 0/1 with 1 and nothing can ever, ever change that.  

* **Errata:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles lose and can’t gain powers (including (*Flight*) and (*Range*)). 
 
* **Ban:** Name a character and choose a number. Put all supporting characters with that name on enemy sides into their owner’s hands. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles have a cost equal to the chosen number and nothing can ever, ever change that. (Except banning it again. You know the old saying: “If you really, really hate a card, ban it twice.”) Any effects that would increase or decrease what an enemy player pays to recruit a banned card are ignored.  



Here are some quick tips:  

* If you steal a character with one of those effects the effect will stop because it’s not an enemy character anymore. Yay! However, if it goes back to an enemy side the effect will turn on again. Boo!  

* When you Ban a character, you can name any number you want. Even a million bazillion. Try it, it’s fun!

* If someone tries to tell you that this isn’t really how nerfing, errata-ing, and banning works, you just take your katana and do some "development” on them, if you know what I mean.

## Ego
Set: MCU Villains  
**Soon We Will Be All There Is**  
Ego’s **Soon We Will Be All There Is** power allows you to turn a face-down location in your resource row face up to become a supporting character. Once this happens it will stop being a location.

## Elektra (MC)
Set: Legacy  
**Hand Experience**  
Elektra (main character) has a super power that allows you to hide her in your hand until your next turn starts. But if she somehow gets discarded from your hand, shuffled into your deck, or otherwise goes anywhere except into play, then you’ll lose the game at the start of your next turn.

## Emma Frost (SC)
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**Fluid Forms and Fidelity**  
When Emma transforms via Fluid Forms and Fidelity, the card that used to be in play is removed from the game. When she transforms, she keeps her orientation (ready/exhausted, face-up/face-down), all of
her counters, and any effects on her.

## Evil Deadpool
Set: Deadpool & Friends   
Made from Deadpool’s discarded body parts that fused back together into a new person, Evil Deadpool gains XP whenever you discard a character. This includes powering up as well as any effect that causes you to “discard” a card (whether you or your opponent controls the effect).

**Merc With an Evil Mouth**  
Evil Deadpool loves being Evil. That’s why he can grant Evil characters on your side the new keyword, Evil Lethal. Evil Lethal works just like regular Lethal except after you KO the supporting defender you laugh evilly. (If you’re unable to laugh evilly you’ll still resolve the effect as much as possible and KO the defender.)  

**It's Like You, But Eviler!**  
Evil Deadpool’s Level 2 super power puts Good characters into play but turns them Evil and adds the word “Evil” at the beginning of their name. Changing their name DOES affect the uniqueness rules. For example, it would allow you to have “Iron Man” and “Evil Iron Man” on your side at the same time. However, you would not be able to add “Evil” to regular Deadpool because then his name would be “Evil Deadpool” which is the same name as your main character. And Evil Deadpool hates Deadpool anyway.

## Falcon
Set: The MCU Battles  
**Air Superiority**  
Falcon’s **Air Superiority** power prevents characters with from striking him. It doesn’t matter if that character is attacking or defending, or if it’s a melee or ranged attack. As long as it has it can’t strike him.

## Fin Fang Foom
Set: Monsters Unleashed!  
Fin Fang Foom and Leviathon Hydra are each able to attack multiple enemies at once. When they do, they will strike with their full ATK against each defender, and the defenders will total up their ATK to strike back.

## Goblin Queen
Set: A-Force  
**Token Characters**  
Goblin Queen has the power to make token characters. A token character works just like a regular character except that if it ever gets put into a KO pile or otherwise leaves play, remove it from the game.

## Green Goblin (MC)
Set: Crossover  
The Sinister Six have gained two new Main Characters to choose from. Remember, when you build a Sinister Six deck, you choose any six Sinister Six characters to go with that deck.

**Bag of Tricks**  
Goblin’s Bag of Tricks allows you to discard Locations to make him more powerful in combat. If this causes Goblin to strike “before each other character,” this means he strikes first even if any of the characters have, for example, a power like Ferocious. And if two Goblins are in combat with that ability, they’ll strike each other at the same time. If you discard an Oscorp Location, it’s like a wild: you can treat it as though it’s any of the other four Locations that you didn’t already discard this combat.

## Headsman
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**Executioner**  
**Ferocious** means – While in melee combat, Headsman strikes before characters without Ferocious.

## Hulk (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
See [Bruce Banner](#wiki_bruce_banner_.28and_the_hulk.29_.28mc.29.)

## Hulk (SC)
Set: The MCU Battles
**Hulk Like Raging Fire**
Hulk’s **Hulk Like Raging Fire** power allows you to choose any number to give him that much ATK and DEF during combat. “Any number” means any whole number. Some popular examples are 7, 15, 211, 45,000, 100,000,000, and 9.

## Ironheart
Set: Crossover
**We’re All Weirdos Here**
**We’re All Weirdos Here** lets your Supporting Characters Team Attack even if they don’t share a team affiliation and even if they’re in different rows. If there’s at least one melee attacker and at least one ranged attacker in the same attack, then the attack itself is both a melee and a ranged attack. Note: Each character must still legally be able to attack the defender.

## Iron Monger (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles
The owner of a character is the player who brought that card to the game, regardless of which side that character is currently on. So Iron Monger’s **Steal Idea** power will trigger when a character that an enemy player “owns” gets recruited, whether that enemy player recruited it themselves or if you used Iron Monger’s **You Had a Great Idea, Tony** power.


## Jessica Jones
Set: Legacy
**Psionic Protection**
This power refers to (Intellect/Light bulb) super powers.
This counts for any super power with the appropriate
symbol in its cost (even if it also has other symbols in
its cost).


## Juggernaut (MC)
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants
**It’s Gonna Take Something More to Stop Me!**
Juggernaut is so big and powerful it’s almost impossible to beat him physically. Fortunately (for his enemies) he’s vulnerable to other kinds of attacks. This is represented on his card by his **It’s Gonna Take Something More to Stop Me!** power, which allows enemy players to spend an *Energy* ("Atom"/"Blue") to weaken him. Note: This works just like any other super power – except an enemy player can only use it once per turn during their Main Phase. And keep in mind special locations like Avengers Mansion can’t be used by an opponent on Juggernaut’s power.

## Kaecilius
Set: MCU Villains
 **Fold Space and Matter**
Kaecilius’s **Fold Space and Matter** power adds a new rule to Vs. System® 2PCG®: an exhausted resource doesn’t produce recruit points. You can still use an exhausted location to pay for a super power.

## Leviathon Hydra
Set: Monsters Unleashed!
See [Fin Fang Foom](#wiki-fin-fang-foom).

## Loki (SC)
The MCU Battles
**I Am Burdened With Glorious Purpose**
Loki’s **I Am Burdened With Glorious Purpose** power lets you discard a character from your hand to increase the stats of a character in combat. Loki himself doesn’t have to be in combat to use this power.

## Magneto (MC)
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants
In this set Magneto gets a whole new main character card, and this time  it goes to Level 3. This card represents Magneto’s desire to bring all mutants together as one. (Note: The version of Magneto can’t level up into the version of him and vice versa. A main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork as it does.)

## Mandarin
Set: The MCU Battles
Mandarin is really three potential characters in one. If Mandarin is in your deck you’ll need to bring your **Behind the Camera** pile with you which includes two copies of **Trevor Slattery** and one copy of **The Ten Rings**. When Mandarin gets KO’d, you’ll remove him from the game, shuffle your Behind the Camera pile, and randomly put one of the three cards there into your hand. 

This represents who Mandarin really is – lowly actor or deadly warlord. Leave the Behind the Camera pile face down – it’s important that your opponent doesn’t find out who the Mandarin really is until you’re ready to show them.

## Masacre
Set: Deadpool & Friends
Masacre es el Deadpool de México, por eso el texto de su juego está escrito en español. No te preocupes. Si no hablas español, traduciremos sus poderes aquí. Él tiene **Mercenario** lo que significa “**Mercenary**,” y **Letal** lo que significa “**Lethal**.”



## Maximus
Set: Crossover
**Usurp the Throne**
**Usurp the Throne** lets Maximus KO another player’s Main Character and take over being that player’s Main Character. However, if they don’t currently have a Main Character, Usurp the Throne won’t do anything.

## Mimic (MC)
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.
**Absorption History**
Mimic’s **Absorption History** represents three characters that he’s copied powers from. In game terms it’s a pile that includes exactly three Main Character cards, one Level 1, one Level 2, and one Level 3. They can only be from the Illustrated Universe and they must have three different names (they can’t share a name through AKA). For example, you could have Cyclops Level 1, Dutch Level 2, and Spider-Man Level 3.

During setup when you reveal Mimic as your Main Character, you’ll also reveal the Level 1 character in your Absorption History. Mimic gains its Keyword and Super Powers only when the game begins. When Mimic becomes Level 2, you’ll reveal the Level 2 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Powers and loses the powers of the Level 1 character he was previously copying.

When Mimic becomes Level 3, you’ll reveal the Level 3 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Powers and loses the powers of the Level 2 character he was previously copying.

**Note:** While **Absorption History** is a Keyword and can technically be turned off by certain effects, turning it off doesn’t affect Mimic’s ability to use the pile (it’s locked in from the beginning of the game).

## Mister Sinister
Set: Legacy
**Genetic Manipulation**
This power grants a Keyword power to a character. Unlike most effects, which only last for a turn or two, this effect lasts until the character leaves play./

## Mister X
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.
**I Can Predict Your Every Move**
**I Can Predict Your Every Move** can temporarily reduce the ATK/DEF of a character while in solo combat with Mister X.For example, if a character with a printed ATK/DEF of 4/4 has three +1/+1 counters it is
currently 7/7. However, while in solo combat with Mister X, itsATK/DEF counts as 4/4.

## Moon Girl
Set: Monsters Unleashed!
See [Devil Dinosaur](#wiki-devil-dinosaur).

## Morgan Le Fay
Set: A-Force
**Growing Magic**
Morgan le Fay’s super power counts how many times you’ve used a power named Growing Magic this game. This means that if you use the power a few times on one card and then later use it on a different card, all of those usages count.

## Mystique (MC)
Set: Legacy
**Identity Theft**
Mystique’s super power allows her to transform into a different Level 2 Main Character. When she does this, remove her from the game and put the new character into play in the same orientation (ready/exhausted) she was in. Move all counters from her onto the new character, applying any effects (such as Freeze) to the new character. 

Playing with friends, you can choose to transform into any character in your collection, but if you’re playing in a tournament, you must select three Main Character options when you build your deck. You must set them face-down next to your unused Level 2/Level 3 characters. (You don’t need to show them to your opponent.)

## Nebula
Set: The MCU Battles
**Rivalry**
Nebula’s **Rivalry** power requires you name a character. You can name any character, including one that isn’t in play.

## Omega Red
Set: Crossover
**Carbonadium Tentacles**
The phrase “could melee attack” means Omega Red can legally attack that character(s) right now. Normally this just means he must be ready and the character(s) must be unprotected.

## Onslaught
Set: Legacy
**Joint Consciousness**
Onslaught’s power occurs when you pay to recruit him, but before he appears. This way he will trigger any “appears” powers on cards he removed from the game.

## Phil Coulson
Set: Crossover
**Special Agent**
Coulson’s **Special Agent** power means when a character with Agent appears on your side, you’ll get to look one card deeper into your deck.

**Level 7 Clearance / I'm a Guy With a Plan**  
His **Level 7 Clearance** and **I’m A Guy With a Plan** count each instance of **Agent** on a character, so FitzSimmons will count as two Agents. And **I’m a Guy With a Plan** will count Coulson himself.

Set: MCU heroes  
**They Need Someone to Avenge**  
Phil’s They Need Someone to Avenge power is not optional. If he’s in your KO pile at the start of your Main Phase, you must remove him from the game and then you can put +1/+1 counters on your characters.



## Pyro
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**Fire Manipulation**  
Pyro’s Fire Manipulation power lets him create a supporting character creature that has the stats of a random character from your deck. The new character uses a physical supporting character card but erases its name, team affiliation, and game text and powers and replaces them with the name Fire Man, the (Brotherhood) team symbol, and the Creature keyword. (Which means it can’t have equipment.) When it’s KO’d or otherwise leaves play the card will go back to counting as the character printed on it.



## Rhino (SC)
Set: Crossover  
**Headlong Charge**  
Rhino “Sidestep” means that the defender stays where it is, but avoids Rhino just enough. The defender doesn’t count as moving. When an enemy front row character sidesteps, you’ll get to pick a new defender in their back row. If there aren’t any, the combat will end. Sorry Rhino!

## Rocket
Set: The MCU Battles  
**I’m Gonna Need a Few Things**  
Rocket’s **I’m Gonna Need a Few Things** power requires you to choose two cards with different names in your KO pile. If you don’t have two cards with two different names, his power will have no effect.

## Rogue
Set: A-Force  
**Absorb Powers**  
Rogue has the ability to gain the keyword and super powers of supporting characters she’s KO’d. When she does this, if that character’s power refers to its own name, use Rogue’s name instead.

## Sauron
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**Terrifying Delusions**  
Sauron’s **Terrifying Delusions** power tricks a main character into striking a supporting character on their side. When this happens compare the main character’s ATK to the supporting character’s DEF to see if it gets stunned. This doesn’t count as a combat and there will be no strike back.

## Scourge
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**Betsy’s Incendiary Missiles**  
**Betsy’s Incendiary Missiles** lets you **Burn** a character. This means “At the end of each of your turns, stun that character.” A Burn effect has no set duration – it will last until the burning character
leaves play.

## Shadow King
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**Anchor Host**  
Shadow King is technically a supporting character but he doesn’t want to actually be in play. He prefers to have a physical host. If he would appear for any reason, you’ll remove him from the game instead and choose a face-up character on your side to be his Host. If you don’t have a face-up character, Shadow King will still be removed from the game. When his Host gets stunned or leaves play Shadow King will remain removed from the game

## She-Hulk (MC)
Set: A-Force  
**Rules Lawyer**  
She-Hulk’s main character introduces a new kind of super power called a **Reaction**. It reads: 

> Reaction : When an enemy player uses a super power, you may say “Objection!” If you do, cancel that super power.

Reaction powers trigger when a certain condition is met (in this case it’s “When an enemy player uses a super power”). When that happens you can pay an (and say “Objection” of course) and if you do it cancels the super power so it never takes effect.

You can use a Reaction power at any time, as long as its trigger condition is met. However, like other super powers, you can only use it once per turn.

## Sif
Set: Crossover  
You can only recruit her by also paying a Might *(Fist/Green)*. If you don’t have one to pay, you can’t recruit her. Note: If she appears somehow without getting recruited, you don’t have to pay a Might *(Fist/Green)*.

## Spider-Gwen
Set: Legacy  
**Dimensional Wristwatch**  
Spider-Gwen can be recruited while she’s in your deck. To do so, announce that you’re recruiting her, then search your deck for her, shuffle your deck, and then pay to recruit her. (Note: You may only announce that you are recruiting her if she actually is in your deck.)

## Squirrel Girl
Set: Legacy  
**Let’s Get Nuts**  
Squirrel Girl’s power lets her put token characters into play. A token character works just like a regular character except that if it ever gets put into a KO pile or otherwise leaves play, it ceases to exist. The token card can be reused later if Squirrel Girl appears again.

## Stand Together
Set: Crossover  
**Stand Together** introduces **Reaction** Plot Twists to the game. When an enemy character uses a Super Power, after they pay any required power symbols, you can play **Stand Together** to cancel it before it takes effect. You must have at least as many face-up characters as the number of power symbols they paid. (If they paid none, then you don’t have to have any face-up characters.)

## Star Lord (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
**Dance Off, Bro**  
Star-Lord (Main Character) Star-Lord’s Level Up power lets you start a Dance Off. Starting with you, each player may exhaust one of their ready characters or they’re out of the Dance Off. Repeat this process until only one player is left. They’re the winner.

## Star Lord (SC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
**Half Celestial**  
Star-Lord’s **Half Celestial** power prevents him from being KO’d as long as you have a face-up main character on your side. However, if Star-Lord has fatal wounds and your main character gets turned face down, Star-Lord will immediately become KO’d.

## Thor (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
**Journey of Self Discovery**  
Thor’s **Journey of Self Discovery** Level Up power requires him to make three separate attacks in the order printed on his card to gain an XP. These attacks don’t have to be in a row. For example, he could make a solo attack, then a team attack with one teammate, then another solo attack, and finally when he team attacks with exactly two other characters he’ll gain an XP.

## Titania
Set: A-Force  
**Durable**  
Titania has the new **Durable** keyword. This means if she gets stunned in some way that isn’t getting struck in combat, she recoversand doesn’t get wounded. 

However, if she was in the middle of combat when she got stunned (perhaps by Sin’s super power), even though
she would recover immediately, getting stunned would still remove her from combat.

## Ultron Facility (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
Ultron is really six main characters in one: three identical Level 1s, two identical Level 2s, and one Level 3. Before the game starts you’ll put one Level 1 Ultron onto your side. The remaining five Ultron cards will start out of play in a face-up pile called your **Ultron Facility**. 

During the game you can use any Ultron’s **There’s Only One Path To Peace** power to put the lowest level Ultron from your Ultron Facility onto your side. When one of your Ultron main 27 characters gets KO’d it goes back to your Ultron Facility where it will be available to be brought back again.

If all your Ultrons are in the Ultron Facility at the same time, you lose the game. 

**Note:** The Level 3 Ultron’s **Your Extinction** power KOs all enemy cards (in a very dramatic way).


## Venom (MC)
Set: Crossover  
The Sinister Six have gained two new Main Characters to choose from. Remember, when you build a **Sinister Six** deck, you choose any six Sinister Six characters to go with that deck.

**Relentless Bond**  
Venom’s **Relentless Bond** will put a +1/+1 counter on him whether or not he’s stunned.
