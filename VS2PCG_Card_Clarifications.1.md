## Ajax
Set: Deadpool & Friends\
**Pain Tolerance**\
Ajax's **Pain Tolerance** power says he can only be KO'd by fatal wounds at the end of a turn. A character has fatal wounds if it has at least as many wounds as its health. So Ajax can have any amount of wounds but won't actually get KO'd until the end of a turn.

## Alcatraz
**It's a Prison**\
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.\
When the character in “prison” turns face up, the player who used Alcatraz decides which row on its original side it goes back to.

## Arnim Zola (MC)
Set: Crossover\
**ESP Box**
ESP Box takes effect once the game starts and lasts the whole game (even while Arnim Zola is stunned, after he levels up, and even after he is KO’d). You can play any Equipment as a Supporting Character, regardless of whether you have a character with a matching team affiliation. When you play one as a Supporting Character, it’s no longer an Equipment. If it has a power that references “Equipped Character,” it is its own equipped character. When the card leaves play it will go back to being an Equipment. You may still play an Equipment normally and equip it to one of your characters (including on an Equipment that you played as a Supporting Character). 



**A New Robot Body**
When Arnim Zola enters A New Robot Body, your new Equipment-turned-Main Character will have ATK/DEF equal to its cost, 1 (Health), Swarm, and it will count as its own “Equipped Character,” just like with ESP Box. When that body gets KO’d, it can use this power again to jump into another robot body, and so on. Note: if you want to use a Wild Special Location to pay for this power, it must match the team affiliation of the Main Character using this power.



## Avalanche
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants
**Sustained Seismic Waves**
Avalanche’s Sustained Seismic Waves power gets stronger each time he uses it. However, if you play a new copy of Avalanche later, the super power on that copy will start over.

**


**

## Blob (MC)
Set: Crossover
**Boing**
If Blob strikes a character and his Boing! power causes that character to strike itself, you add Blob’s ATK to that character’s own ATK to see if it’s enough to stun it. 
**Immovable Object**
If Blob moves for any reason (including during your Formation Step or because another effect moves him), he will be prevented from gaining an XP. At the end of Blob’s first turn of the game, he will gain an XP if he didn’t move that turn.



## Blob (SC)
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants
**Stuck in His Stomach**
Blob’s Stuck in His Stomach power represents a melee attacker getting temporarily trapped by Blob’s flab. This effect will take place even if Blob gets KO’d in the attack. (Just imagine him unconscious lying on top of the attacker.) 
**Bounced Off His Belly**
And his Bounced Off His Belly power represents projectiles getting bounced back at any ranged attackers. Note: In the event that Blob somehow had (Range) he would not strike back using his own ATK because Bounced Off His Belly’s strike back would override his normal strike back.

## Break the Fourth Wall
Set: Deadpool & Friends
This plot twist really lets you get in the game. When you put a “Me” token onto your side, you get to choose a team affiliation and your age will determine your ATK and DEF. You’ll have Leader because you’re still in charge of your team, but don’t worry – if you get KO’d you don’t lose the game because you’re also still a player. We figure you have more questions about all this, so let’s dive in. 
* **How do you prove your age?** If you’re at a tournament you’ll need an ID with a birthday. If you don’t have one, we’ll just pretend you’re 11.
* **Does this card have different power levels for different players depending on their age?** Yes.
* **Isn’t that ageist?** Great question. Think about it this way: Yes.
* **What happens if I’m 29 and tomorrow’s my birthday, but then it turns to midnight in the middle of the game?** You’ll become a 3/0 and get stunned.
* **Isn’t that kind of stupid?** Play faster next time.
* **I feel like you’re not taking this seriously.** That’s not a question.

## Bullseye (MC)
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.
**Perfect Aim**
When Bullseye uses **Perfect Aim** it will give him ATK until it’s equal to the defender’s DEF. But if the Defender gains or loses DEF later in the combat, that won’t affect Bullseye’s ATK.

**Everything’s a Weapon**
With **Everything’s a Weapon**, you’ll put the top card of your deck into your KO pile before you choose which enemy character to apply the effect to.



## Chimichanga
Set: Deadpool & Friends
Deadpool’s favorite deep-fried burrito has two different costs to use its super power. You must choose which cost to pay – you can’t combine them. For example, you couldn’t pay **(Energy)** and **(Intellect)** and then say Chimichanga twice. That would be madness.



## Daken
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants
**Pheromone Control**
Daken’s **Pheromone Control** power takes away enemy characters’ powers while they’re in melee combat with him. This will prevent triggered powers like **Shrink** or **Berserker** from triggering in the first place.



## Dark Phoenix (SC)
Set: Crossover
**Deconstruct the Universe**
Dark Phoenix When Dark Phoenix Deconstructs the Universe, an entire concept of the game gets removed for the rest of the game (even if she leaves play). If, as a result of this, the wording of a card’s power is unclear, the part that is unclear does nothing. Here’s how removing each concept works:
* **+1/+1 and -1/-1 counters:** Remove all of those counters from the game. Remove the phrases “+1/+1 counter” and “-1/-1 counter” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause these counters to enter the game in any way
* **Equipment**: Remove all Equipment cards everywhere from the game. This includes all sides, decks, hands, KO piles, and Equipment that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Equipment cards but don’t currently count as Equipment (such as a face-down resource or an Equipment that has become a character via Arnim Zola’s **ESP Box**). Remove the term “Equipment” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Equipment to enter the game in any way.
* **Keyword text:** Removing this concept doesn’t affect **Flight** and **Range**. Remove all Keyword text from the game, including powers that “can’t be turned off”. Remove the term “Keyword” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Keyword text to enter the game in any way.
* **Levels:** All Main Characters everywhere become Level 1 if possible. Remove all remaining Level 2 and higher Main Characters from the game. Remove all Level Up Powers and XP from the game, and the terms “Level” and “XP” from all card text. Ignore any effects that would cause XP or a Level 2 or higher Main Character to enter the game in any way.
* **Plot Twists:** Remove all Plot Twist cards everywhere from the game. This includes all decks, hands, KO piles, and Plot Twists that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Plot Twist cards but are not currently Plot Twists (such as a face-down resource). Remove the term “Plot Twist” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause a Plot Twist to enter the game in any way.
* **Super Powers:** Remove all Super Powers from the game. Remove the term “Super Power” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Super Powers to enter the game in any way.



## Deadpool (MC)
Set: Deadpool & Friends
> Hiya kids, it’s your old pal, Deadpool. Guess what? I’m the FIrst character in the game to go all the way to Level 4. There’s probably a break-the-fourth-wall joke in there somewhere, but I haven’t found it yet. Anyhoo, the powers that be want me to tell you that even though I’m now on two different main character cards, the (X-Men) and (Underworld) versions of me can’t level up into each other.
> 
> It’s because a main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork. And guess what? I don’t mean to brag but I’m actually a designer now. You know all the cards in this set that you love? That’s right -- I designed them. (All the cards that you hate were designed by those other two dummies.) Designing stuff is sweet. You can pretty much do whatever you want.
> 
> I like designing so much, I wanted to do some while I was in the game too. My new main character can **nerf** stuff, **errata** stuff, and even **ban** stuff. Check it out:



**I'm Taking Over From These Idiot Designers**
* **Nerf:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks, and KO piles are 0/1 with 1 and nothing can ever, ever change that.
* **Errata:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles lose and can’t gain powers (including (*Flight*) and (*Range*)).
* **Ban:** Name a character and choose a number. Put all supporting characters with that name on enemy sides into their owner’s hands. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles have a cost equal to the chosen number and nothing can ever, ever change that. (Except banning it again. You know the old saying: “If you really, really hate a card, ban it twice.”) Any effects that would increase or decrease what an enemy player pays to recruit a banned card are ignored.



Here are some quick tips: 
* If you steal a character with one of those effects the effect will stop because it’s not an enemy character anymore. Yay! However, if it goes back to an enemy side the effect will turn on again. Boo! 
* When you Ban a character, you can name any number you want. Even a million bazillion. Try it, it’s fun! 
* If someone tries to tell you that this isn’t really how nerfing, errata-ing, and banning works, you just take your katana and do some "development” on them, if you know what I mean.

## Emma Frost (SC)
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.
**Fluid Forms and Fidelity**
When Emma transforms via Fluid Forms and Fidelity, the card that used to be in play is removed from the game. When she transforms, she keeps her orientation (ready/exhausted, face-up/face-down), all of
her counters, and any effects on her.

## Evil Deadpool
Set: Deadpool & Friends
Made from Deadpool’s discarded body parts that fused back together into a new person, Evil Deadpool gains XP whenever you discard a character. This includes powering up as well as any effect that causes you to “discard” a card (whether you or your opponent controls the effect). 

**Merc With an Evil Mouth**
Evil Deadpool loves being Evil. That’s why he can grant Evil characters on your side the new keyword, Evil Lethal. Evil Lethal works just like regular Lethal except after you KO the supporting defender you laugh evilly. (If you’re unable to laugh evilly you’ll still resolve the effect as much as possible and KO the defender.)

**It's Like You, But Eviler!**
Evil Deadpool’s Level 2 super power puts Good characters into play but turns them Evil and adds the word “Evil” at the beginning of their name. Changing their name DOES affect the uniqueness rules. For example, it would allow you to have “Iron Man” and “Evil Iron Man” on your side at the same time. However, you would not be able to add “Evil” to regular Deadpool because then his name would be “Evil Deadpool” which is the same name as your main character. And Evil Deadpool hates Deadpool anyway.

## Goblin Queen
Set: A-Force
**Token Characters**
Goblin Queen has the power to make token characters. A token character works just like a regular character except that if it ever gets put into a KO pile or otherwise leaves play, remove it from the game.

## Green Goblin (MC)
Set: Crossover
The Sinister Six have gained two new Main Characters to choose from. Remember, when you build a Sinister Six deck, you choose any six Sinister Six characters to go with that deck. 

**Bag of Tricks**
Goblin’s Bag of Tricks allows you to discard Locations to make him more powerful in combat. If this causes Goblin to strike “before each other character,” this means he strikes first even if any of the characters have, for example, a power like Ferocious. And if two Goblins are in combat with that ability, they’ll strike each other at the same time. If you discard an Oscorp Location, it’s like a wild: you can treat it as though it’s any of the other four Locations that you didn’t already discard this combat.

## Headsman
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.
**Executioner**
**Ferocious** means – While in melee combat, Headsman strikes before characters without Ferocious.

## Ironheart
Set: Crossover
**We’re All Weirdos Here**
**We’re All Weirdos Here** lets your Supporting Characters Team Attack even if they don’t share a team affiliation and even if they’re in different rows. If there’s at least one melee attacker and at least one ranged attacker in the same attack, then the attack itself is both a melee and a ranged attack. Note: Each character must still legally be able to attack the defender.

## Juggernaut (MC)
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants
**It’s Gonna Take Something More to Stop Me!**
Juggernaut is so big and powerful it’s almost impossible to beat him physically. Fortunately (for his enemies) he’s vulnerable to other kinds of attacks. This is represented on his card by his **It’s Gonna Take Something More to Stop Me!** power, which allows enemy players to spend an *Energy* ("Atom"/"Blue") to weaken him. Note: This works just like any other super power – except an enemy player can only use it once per turn during their Main Phase. And keep in mind special locations like Avengers Mansion can’t be used by an opponent on Juggernaut’s power.

## Magneto (MC)
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants
In this set Magneto gets a whole new main character card, and this time  it goes to Level 3. This card represents Magneto’s desire to bring all mutants together as one. (Note: The version of Magneto can’t level up into the version of him and vice versa. A main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork as it does.)

## Masacre
Set: Deadpool & Friends
Masacre es el Deadpool de México, por eso el texto de su juego está escrito en español. No te preocupes. Si no hablas español, traduciremos sus poderes aquí. Él tiene **Mercenario** lo que significa “**Mercenary**,” y **Letal** lo que significa “**Lethal**.”



## Maximus
Set: Crossover
**Usurp the Throne**
**Usurp the Throne** lets Maximus KO another player’s Main Character and take over being that player’s Main Character. However, if they don’t currently have a Main Character, Usurp the Throne won’t do anything.

## Mimic (MC)
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.
**Absorption History**
Mimic’s **Absorption History** represents three characters that he’s copied powers from. In game terms it’s a pile that includes exactly three Main Character cards, one Level 1, one Level 2, and one Level 3. They can only be from the Illustrated Universe and they must have three different names (they can’t share a name through AKA). For example, you could have Cyclops Level 1, Dutch Level 2, and Spider-Man Level 3.

During setup when you reveal Mimic as your Main Character, you’ll also
reveal the Level 1 character in your Absorption History. Mimic gains its
Keyword and Super Powers only when the game begins. When Mimic becomes Level 2, you’ll reveal the Level 2 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Powers and loses the powers of the Level 1 character he was previously copying.

When Mimic becomes Level 3, you’ll reveal the Level 3 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Powers and loses the powers of the Level 2 character he was previously copying.

**Note:** While **Absorption History** is a Keyword and can technically be turned off by certain effects, turning it off doesn’t affect Mimic’s ability to use the pile (it’s locked in from the beginning of the game).

## Mister X
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.
** I Can Predict Your Every Move **
I Can Predict Your Every Movecan temporarily reduce theATK/DEF of a character while insolo combat with Mister X.For example, if a characterwith a printed ATK/DEF of 4/4has three +1/+1 counters it is
currently 7/7. However, while in solo combat with Mister X, itsATK/DEF counts as 4/4.

## Morgan Le Fay
Set: A-Force
**Growing Magic**
Morgan le Fay’s super power counts how many times you’ve used a power named Growing Magic this game. This means that if you use the power a few times on one card and then later use it on a different card, all of those usages count.



## Omega Red
Set: Crossover
**Carbonadium Tentacles**
The phrase “could melee attack” means Omega Red can legally attack that character(s) right now. Normally this just means he must be ready and the character(s) must be unprotected.



## Phil Coulson
Set: Crossover
**Special Agent**
Coulson’s **Special Agent** power means when a character with Agent appears on your side, you’ll get to look one card deeper into your deck. 



**Level 7 Clearance / I'm a Guy With a Plan**
His **Level 7 Clearance** and **I’m A Guy With a Plan** count each instance of **Agent** on a character, so FitzSimmons will count as two Agents. And **I’m a Guy With a Plan** will count Coulson himself.



## Pyro
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants
**Fire Manipulation**
Pyro’s Fire Manipulation power lets him create a supporting character creature that has the stats of a random character from your deck. The new character uses a physical supporting character card but erases its name, team affiliation, and game text and powers and replaces them with the name Fire Man, the (Brotherhood) team symbol, and the Creature keyword. (Which means it can’t have equipment.) When it’s KO’d or otherwise leaves play the card will go back to counting as the character printed on it.



## Rhino (SC)
Set: Crossover
**Headlong Charge**
Rhino “Sidestep” means that the defender stays where it is, but avoids Rhino just enough. The defender doesn’t count as moving. When an enemy front row character sidesteps, you’ll get to pick a new defender in their back row. If there aren’t any, the combat will end. Sorry Rhino!



## Rogue
Set: A-Force
**Absorb Powers**
Rogue has the ability to gain the keyword and super powers of supporting characters she’s KO’d. When she does this, if that character’s power refers to its own name, use Rogue’s name instead.



## Sauron
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants
**Terrifying Delusions**
Sauron’s **Terrifying Delusions** power tricks a main character into striking a supporting character on their side. When this happens compare the main character’s ATK to the supporting character’s DEF to see if it gets stunned. This doesn’t count as a combat and there will be no strike back.

## Scourge
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.
**Betsy’s Incendiary Missiles**
**Betsy’s Incendiary Missiles** lets you **Burn** a character. This means “At the end of each of your turns, stun that character.” A Burn effect has no set duration – it will last until the burning character
leaves play.

## Shadow King
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants
**Anchor Host**
Shadow King is technically a supporting character but he doesn’t want to actually be in play. He prefers to have a physical host. If he would appear for any reason, you’ll remove him from the game instead and choose a face-up character on your side to be his Host. If you don’t have a face-up character, Shadow King will still be removed from the game. When his Host gets stunned or leaves play Shadow King will remain removed from the game

## She-Hulk (MC)
Set: A-Force
**Rules Lawyer**
She-Hulk’s main character introduces a new kind of super power called a **Reaction**. It reads: 



> Reaction : When an enemy player uses a super power, you may say “Objection!” If you do, cancel that super power.



Reaction powers trigger when a certain condition is met (in this case it’s “When an enemy player uses a super power”). When that happens you can pay an (and say “Objection” of course) and if you do it cancels the super power so it never takes effect.
You can use a Reaction power at any time, as long as its trigger condition is met. However, like other super powers, you can only use it once per turn.



## Sif
Set: Crossover
You can only recruit her by also paying a Might *(Fist/Green)* . If you don’t have one to pay, you can’t recruit her. Note: If she appears somehow without getting recruited, you don’t have to pay a Might *(Fist/Green)* .



## Stand Together
Set: Crossover
**Stand Together** introduces **Reaction** Plot Twists to the game. When an enemy character uses a Super Power, after they pay any required power symbols, you can play **Stand Together** to cancel it before it takes effect. You must have at least as many face-up characters as the number of power symbols they paid. (If they paid none, then you don’t have to have any face-up characters.)



## Titania
Set: A-Force
**Durable**
Titania has the new **Durable** keyword. This means if she gets stunned in some way that isn’t getting struck in combat, she recovers
and doesn’t get wounded. However, if she was in the middle of combat when she got stunned (perhaps by Sin’s super power), even though
she would recover immediately, getting stunned would still remove her from combat.



## Venom (MC)
Set: Crossover
The Sinister Six have gained two new Main Characters to choose from. Remember, when you build a **Sinister Six** deck, you choose any six Sinister Six characters to go with that deck.



**Relentless Bond**
Venom’s **Relentless Bond** will put a +1/+1 counter on him whether or not he’s stunned.
