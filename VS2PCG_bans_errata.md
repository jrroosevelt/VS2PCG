# Major Rulings, Errata, Bans, FAQ

This page is intended to be a one-stop reference for new and returning players to list official rule changes and any major clarifications made by the designers of the game Ben Cichoski and Danny Mandel along with head judge/rules guru/rulebook author/man with many names Chad Daniel.

## Bans & Errata

### **Thanos MC (Marvel Battles)**

* *The Main Character Thanos included in the Marvel Battles Core set is no longer tournament legal*

A [replacement](https://i.imgur.com/iA4Agsr.jpg) [Thanos MC](https://i.imgur.com/FZxRu2W.jpg) was released with the Legacy set.  The new version of Thanos only gains experience when opposing characters are KO'd and Infinity Gauntlet now causes a single random discard instead of discarding the entire hand.  Thanos was very oppressive to the game's early meta.

### **Cosmo (Marvel Battles)**

* *The [Support Character Cosmo](https://i.imgur.com/heBjaR0.jpg) included in the Marvel Battles Core set is no longer tournament legal*

A [replacement Cosmo](https://i.imgur.com/5Jl1i9L.png) was released with the Legacy set.  The new version of Cosmo has a Nullify power with a duration that ends at the end of the turn in which Cosmo appeared.  The original Cosmo was seen as an auto-include.  He was changed to open up the meta to more creativity.

### **Singularity SC (A-Force set)**

* *The [Support Character Singularity](https://i.imgur.com/BVJIkxO.jpg) included in the A-Force set is no longer tournament legal.*

Singularity was banned and [replaced](https://i.imgur.com/3vlwcdR.jpg) in the SHIELD VS Hydra set with a new version that balanced her power with many of the new cards in that set to prevent abuse.  Her power "Pocket Dimension" is now a Reaction Super Power that costs a Blue power symbol.  The effect is the same but the controller must pay Blue to activate it at the end of their turn.  Being a Super Power and no longer a Keyword also means that Taskmaster will no longer gain the effect.

### **The Space Gem (Black Order set)**

* *[The Space Gem](https://imgur.com/Jj3gh99) has received errata so that characters removed from the game keep their counters*

The power "I Can Be Everywhere or Nowhere" has two potential effects.  The second effect reads "remove a character from the game and at the start of its owner's next turn put it on their side."  The text has received the correction "remove a character from the game with its counters on it and at the start of its owner's next turn put it on their side."  The original text would drop all counters from the selected character.  It was never the intention of this card to allow what is effectively a full heal on your Main Character.  This misprint was quickly caught and corrected by the designers for obvious reasons.

### **Hulk (New Defenders set)**

* *The [8 cost supporting character Hulk from Defenders](https://i.imgur.com/nHtnJGe.jpg) received errata to prevent unintended interaction with [Dramatic Entrance](https://imgur.com/bit8aVS)*

Hulk's keyword power "Puny Weapons Can't Hurt Hulk* now reads "Hulk can't be KO'd in combat by an enemy character unless Hulk has fatal wounds. This power remains on while he is stunned."  The clause "by an enemy character" has been added to prevent unintended interactions such as that with the card Dramatic Entrance that was called the "Dramatic Hulk" combo and was only briefly legal.  Dramatic Entrance will now KO Hulk as intended.

### **Gambit MC**

* *Gambit's level up condition is misprinted and should read "Level Up (4) â€“ When you discard one or more cards, Gambit gains an XP."*

This was part of the [July 2019 Rules Updates](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y95RZDM2Ualcn__Z87UTj9kvFgiXk73N/view?fbclid=IwAR2fMgAc9SM3uLepVY2dO1MWQzSHJoBztx7gD9VR3IhbogRIIPBe8upAotw)

### **Death MC**

* *Death MC will die after she has taken 8 wounds, regardless of which side is face up.*

This was part of the [July 2019 Rules Updates](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y95RZDM2Ualcn__Z87UTj9kvFgiXk73N/view?fbclid=IwAR2fMgAc9SM3uLepVY2dO1MWQzSHJoBztx7gD9VR3IhbogRIIPBe8upAotw)

### **Shadowcat SC**

* *Shadowcat's power should read: "[ANYTURN] Any Combat [ENERGY]: If an attacker or defender is on your side, put Shadowcat next to it. If you do, cancel the combat. Shadowcat can only use this power while she is in your hand."*

This was the second change to Shadowcat.  The first added "Any Combat" to the phase due to a misprint.  The second updated her text to include the "If you do" clause.  This was part of the [July 2019 Rules Updates](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y95RZDM2Ualcn__Z87UTj9kvFgiXk73N/view?fbclid=IwAR2fMgAc9SM3uLepVY2dO1MWQzSHJoBztx7gD9VR3IhbogRIIPBe8upAotw)

### **Infinity Gauntlet**

* *Gems that are inset in your row will count as equipment on your side for all card effects.*

This was a clarification of a ruling made by Chad at Origins.  For a short time the interim ruling was that they do not count as equipment but the [July 2019 Rules Update](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y95RZDM2Ualcn__Z87UTj9kvFgiXk73N/view?fbclid=IwAR2fMgAc9SM3uLepVY2dO1MWQzSHJoBztx7gD9VR3IhbogRIIPBe8upAotw) clarified the designers' intent.

### **Mimic**

* *Mimic will not gain the benefits of any powers that must resolve before the start of the game or during setup.*

In the [June 2020 Rules update](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2020/06/vs-system-2pcg-rules-changes-and-clarifications-june-2020/), a small change to Mimic was made to clarify that he would not gain "setup" benefits from main characters such as Devil Dino, Scarlet Spider or a Sinister Six MC if they were chosen in his Absorption History.  Effects that resolve at the start of the game such as Arnim Zola's ESP Box are unaffected.

## Misprints

### **Private Hudson**

* *The Super Power "You Want Some of This?!" is [misprinted](https://i.imgur.com/zcdSzte.jpg) and costs a Red power symbol to activate*

### **Mr. Black MC**

* *Enhanced Bio-mask Super Power on the Level 2 version of Mr. Black has received errata to have a one-turn duration.*

[As written](https://i.imgur.com/yYqw8Ri.jpg), Enhanced Bio-mask would only need to be activated once per game and it would stay active as long as Mr. Black didn't leave play.  The effect received [errata](https://i.imgur.com/NePF8qJ.jpg) to specify a one turn duration for the power.  It is unclear whether this was a misprint or design change.  The correctly worded version of the card can be ordered from Upper Deck via the [Predator Battles Card Redemption Form](http://upperdeckblog.com/2018/01/vs-system-2pcg-the-predator-battles-card-replacement-redemption/)

### **Jungle Hunter MC**

* *"The Demon Who Makes Trophies of Man" Super Power is [misprinted](https://i.imgur.com/Mp20EPL.jpg) on the Level 2 version of Jungle Hunter.  The [level 1 version](https://i.imgur.com/IQezKtd.jpg) has the correct effect.*

The power *does not* get weaker when Jungle Hunter levels as it may appear.  The [promotional version](https://i.imgur.com/l5yn6AT.jpg) of Level 2 Jungle Hunter also has the correct text, but this was a GenCon exclusive release so most players will not have access to that version of the card.  The correctly worded version of the card can be ordered from Upper Deck via the [Predator Battles Card Redemption Form](http://upperdeckblog.com/2018/01/vs-system-2pcg-the-predator-battles-card-replacement-redemption/)

### ***Mysterio MC***

* *In the [Friendly Neighborhood set](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2020/03/vs-system-2pcg-friendly-neighborhood-card-preview-mysterious/?fbclid=IwAR0Fuo-OuTRNMy2Urd5l-wLPZtrnAg4Nsx70IBAonWCNN72WcPEgBMUvWlA), [Mysterio](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/39-2020-upper-deck-marvel-mcu-vs-system-2pcg-friendly-neighborhood-main-character-mysterio-l1-correct.jpg) was misprinted.

Mysterio's first power "You Don't Want Any Part of This" was intended to allow you to place a Hologram onto an enemy side, aiding in his level up condition.  The [original misprinted version](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/39-2020-upper-deck-marvel-mcu-vs-system-2pcg-friendly-neighborhood-main-character-mysterio-l1-error.jpg) was sent out with the first printing of the set.  You can email qa@upperdeck.com for a [corrected copy of Mysterio](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/39-2020-upper-deck-marvel-mcu-vs-system-2pcg-friendly-neighborhood-main-character-mysterio-l1-correct.jpg)


## Major Rulings/Changes

### **Side-Decks**

* *Side decks are only accessible by their owner*

Previously, if a character on your side were to gain an ability that requires a side deck, you would use your opponent's side deck to resolve the ability.  A common example is Taskmaster gaining "Hatch" from an opponent's Ovomorph.  This rule was changed so that side decks are never accessible except by their owner.  In the example, Taskmaster would gain Hatch but it would fail to resolve since the controller doesn't own a side deck.  You are not allowed to build a side deck unless you have associated the characters, so you can't just bring a Facehugger pile in case you would like your Taskmaster to Hatch unless you also have an Ovomorph in your deck.

### **Mantle mechanic**

* *Characters sharing a name but with stars around their name are considered different characters in all circumstances.*

Originally, characters sharing a mantle were considered to share a name for the purposes of naming a card with effects like [Ronan's "Accuse."](https://i.imgur.com/BPEJVma.png)  Now, each character is unique and must be identified uniquely enough that your opponent knows which card you are referring to.  This was changed from Legacy to the Monsters Unleashed sets by the designers as the old implementation was restricting the kinds of cards they wanted to design.

*  *Characters with similar names from different Intellectual Properties are never considered to be sharing a Mantle.*

Originally, Bishop from the Aliens Battles' Weyland Yutani affiliation (Fox IP) and \*Bishop\* from the X-Men affiliation (Marvel IP) were technically considered to be sharing a mantle.  The star treatment was placed on \*Bishop\* when he was released so he wouldn't trigger uniqueness with Bishop from Aliens but it created this conflict.  This rule was changed to be more thematic since this instance just happened to be a coincidence and didn't make any sense thematically.

### **"Lethal" Keyword**

* *The Lethal keyword now reads "If this character wounds a defending supporting character, KO it."*

This was the second change to the Lethal keyword, but it was intended to allow Lethal to function in a more intuitive way.  For a look at the old wording of the effect, see [Gamora SC](https://i.imgur.com/wo3FBXc.jpg)  Now, characters with Lethal will inflict what can be considered a Lethal wound.  Changes to Lethal were due to unintended interactions with Black Cat MC, Lilith, Grandmaster and the Collector.  For an in-depth look at this change, read Chad Daniel's article [here.](http://dailymetagame.com/under-the-hood-2-the-rules-you-need-not-the-rules-you-deserve/)

### **Definition of "Playing" a Card**

* *Definition of playing a card has been expanded to include recruiting characters*

The MCU set introduced a new Iron Man MC that allows you to draw a card each time you "play" a card.  The designers saw fit to clarify the definition of playing a card to include recruiting characters to make this power more useful.  Inclusive of the old definition, the following events are considered playing a card:  Playing a Plot Twist, placing a resource or location, recruiting a character or equipment, any card effect that allows you to "play" or "recruit" cards from other zones.  NOT considered playing a card: Discarding a location to power a super power, discarding a character to power-up, card effects that "put into play" or otherwise don't state "play" or "recruit."

### **Attacking a face down character**

* *Some effects allow you to declare attacks on face-down characters.  If a face-down character would be stunned by an attack declared this way, wound it instead.*

Stunned characters can't be stunned and won't go through the normal process of applying a wound, resolving stun triggers, etc.  The Sinister Six [Green Goblin SC](https://i.imgur.com/3oRHLvz.jpg) has an ability that would allow it to "strike" a character and since there is no text specifying the target must be face-up, targetting a face-down character would be legal.  However since there is no attack taking place, the special rules for attacking a face down character do not apply here.  Essentially, even if Goblin can strike and stun a stunned character, since stunned characters can't be stunned by game rules, nothing would happen.  Note that if the face down character was instead hidden, the rules do state that hidden characters can still be stunned so fire away.

### **Characters that try to appear but cannot will be removed from the game instead.**

This was part of the [July 2019 Rules Updates](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y95RZDM2Ualcn__Z87UTj9kvFgiXk73N/view?fbclid=IwAR2fMgAc9SM3uLepVY2dO1MWQzSHJoBztx7gD9VR3IhbogRIIPBe8upAotw).  The interaction with \*Star Lord\* AKA Shadowcat and Shadowcat MC was the target here.  Before the change, Shadowcat would stay in the hand after activation (since she couldn't "appear" with AKA Shadowcat as your MC), allowing you to use her power again if you still had a Blue.

### **If a main character doesn't have a lower level version, it will remain at its current level.**

For example, Archangel Level 2 doesn't have a Level 1 version so it will remain as is. The same is true for the MCU Hulk Level 2.  A card that "transforms" to level 2 does so because their level 2 version doesn't have the same name as their level 1 (AKA doesn't matter in the case of leveling up.)  Note that a card that "becomes" level 2 such as Black Suit Spider-Man is not the same.  He is still considered to be leveling up so he can be prevented from leveling with Hex and regressed with something like FF Dark Phoenix SC, UW Baron Mordo MC or MCU Hero Scarlet Witch SC.

### **Loyalty**

* *Loyalty now reads "Put this in your deck only if each card with a team affiliation and each character in your deck share a
team affiliation."*

Unaffiliated characters can no longer go into a Loyalty deck.  This was part of the [July 2019 Rules Update.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y95RZDM2Ualcn__Z87UTj9kvFgiXk73N/view?fbclid=IwAR2fMgAc9SM3uLepVY2dO1MWQzSHJoBztx7gD9VR3IhbogRIIPBe8upAotw)

* *Side decks are no longer considered for loyalty.*

In the [June 2020 Rules Update](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2020/06/vs-system-2pcg-rules-changes-and-clarifications-june-2020/), a change was applied to Loyalty rules so a side deck no longer needs to adhere to Loyal restrictions.  The ruling was in response to Invention decks requiring the inclusion of "Automaton" (an unaffiliated supporting character) in the Invention pile, meaning no Inventor could be in a loyalty deck.

### **Players paying for powers**

* *Multiple cards received errata to specify that characters pay for powers, not players.*

This rule change is to unify the intent that a Wild location can be used to generate a power symbol for an effect like Rhino's Stupid or Juggernaut's "It's Gonna Take Something More To Stop Me!"  See the [July 2019 Rules Update.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y95RZDM2Ualcn__Z87UTj9kvFgiXk73N/view?fbclid=IwAR2fMgAc9SM3uLepVY2dO1MWQzSHJoBztx7gD9VR3IhbogRIIPBe8upAotw) for a complete explanation.

## Individual Card Rulings/Changes


### **Alien Symbiote**

* *If a character that is equipped with the [Alien Symbiote](https://i.imgur.com/rKPvFQT.png) gains an equipment card, put the Alien Symbiote in the KO pile.*

The text on Alien Symbiote says that it cannot be KO'd but the One-Equip rule in the rule book will override this text if the character is equipped with another equipment card.  Cards must explicitly (not implicitly) override game mechanics and this was ruled that it was not intended to override the one-equipment rule.

## Tournament Rules

### **Split Universe**

* *In a [blog post](http://upperdeckblog.com/2018/04/vs-system-2pcg-the-mcu-battles-card-preview-a-new-universe/) it was announced that VS will contain two separate universes.*

For deck building only, cards with a photographic image are part of the "photographic universe" and cards with an illustrated image are part of the "illustrated universe" and a deck cannot contain a mix of both.  Uniqueness still applies across both universes, however.  For example, this means that if you were to gain control of your opponent's Main Character Hulk and you controlled Hulk SC from the Marvel Battles, your Hulk would be KO'd by uniqueness.  Mantles (character names with one or more *'s around them) are still considered distinctly different for all purposes.

### **Featured Formats**

* *All Upper Deck sanctioned tournaments will use the current [Featured Format,](http://upperdeckblog.com/2018/09/vs-system-2pcg-introducing-featured-formats/) which will change the legal cards for the events.*

The VS 2PCG version of "rotation" takes the form of Featured Format.  More information on the current featured format and upcoming events can be found here on the [reddit wiki events page] or at the article linked above.

From the article: *A Featured Format is a set of special rules that affect the game for a three-month period. For example, one Featured Format might say you can only build a deck using cards from specific expansions. Another Featured Format might only allow cards from specific teams. And a third type of Featured Format might require you to choose from a restricted selection of Main Characters.  Tournaments sanctioned by Upper Deck will use the Current Featured Format. We also encourage local stores running tournaments as well as folks playing at home to try out the current Featured Format... with the Vs. System 2PCG we donâ€™t ever want older cards to become obsolete. Featured Formats allow us to temporarily remove cards from the environment in a variety of different ways like highlighting certain main characters, certain teams, or certain universes.*

### **Tournament Side-Decks**

* *If you choose Mystique as your main character in a tournament, you are required to construct a side-deck of only 3 main characters for Mystique to transform into with her [Level 3 power.](https://i.imgur.com/Z8sLLtq.jpg)  You are also required to bring any higher or lower level versions of those main characters.*

The limitation is on *characters,* not number of cards.  So, it is possible to choose Groot, Kingpin and Spider-Man as your three main characters in your Transform side-deck and have a side-deck of 12 cards since each has a level 1, two level 2's and a level 3.

* *Professor X's Graduate Side Deck*

If you're using the Professor X MC from the New Mutants set, you'll need to bring a side deck of all the Main characters (all levels) for any support character in your deck so you are prepared for any one of them to "Graduate" into a main character.

### **Tournament Round Limit**

* *At this time, a standard time limit for tournament matches is 30 minutes.  Each event can define their own limitations, but this is the standard.*

Some events in the past have used a 35 minute time limit as well, but these appear to have been event-specific.


If I've missed any other major rulings, let a moderator know and we can get it added.
