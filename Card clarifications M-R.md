^CardNumber: ^ALN-023

*Set: The Alien Battles*

Q: Are equipment powers separate from character powers. Ex. Does Cosmo shut off the equipment on the character?

A: This has been changed as of the [August 2021 Rules update](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2021/08/vs-system-2pcg-rules-update-august-2021/). Powers are no longer assigned to the character the equipment is attached to (with some exceptions). See also [this article for a full explanation](https://www.thebuildphasenetwork.com/articleblog/digesting-2021-equip-rules).

---

Q: Does activating the **M-40 Grenade** give Storm MC an XP?

A: "The Equipment gives the character new powers and will stay with it until that character gets stunned or leaves play."    
So the character has the power and the character is using it, so yes, this would count for Storm.

Q: If I want to use a wild location to pay for the Super Power granted by Equipment, which one do I need to use?

A: Since the equipped character pays for the power, any wild location will need to match the equipped character's team affiliation.

---

Q: Does using the **M-40 Grenade** ability count as that character causing the stun (if it stuns?)

A: The equipped character gets credit if an equipment power stuns a character. If the -3/-3 stuns a character they would get credit. Also if they are looking for credit KOing a character and the -3/-3 KOs them, they get credit for the KO.

# [Mad Thinker](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-040.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FAN-040

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

The Mad Thinker's **Computer Mind** is so powerful he can very accurately predict what his enemies are going to do. When you make a **Prediction**, secretly write down the name of two characters; an attacker and a defender. The names don't have to be characters in play at the time Mad Thinker uses the super power. When a character with the attacker's name attacks a character on your side with the defender's name (even in a team attack), cancel the combat. Then make another **Prediction** about the same turn, but this time you'll have a lot more data! You can make a maximum of two **Predictions** from each use of the super power.

In this set Magneto gets a whole new main character card, and this time  it goes to Level 3. This card represents Magneto’s desire to bring all mutants together as one. (Note: The version of Magneto can’t level up into the version of him and vice versa. A main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork as it does.)

Q: On Hydra Magneto, does "all enemy equipment" mean "all equipment on enemy sides" or "all equipment owned by an enemy"? For example, I'm wondering if it would KO Inhibitor Collars that an opponent attached to my characters that are on my side?

A: Magneto does KO equipment owned by the enemy (such as Inhibitor Collars played by the enemy).

# [The Maker](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FRI-015.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FRI-015

*Set: The Frightful*

If the Maker is in your deck, you get to have the usual Invention pile, plus you can add up to five Equipment to it. They must be different cards (same name but different game text is fine) and can’t already have the Keyword  **Invention**. (You can also include copies of those Equipment in your deck if you like, and the copies in your Invention pile don’t count against them. For example, you can have a  **One of a Kind** Equipment in your deck and the same one in your Invention pile.)

**Note**: While the Maker (and only the Maker) can Invent those Equipment, you can still only play them if you meet their play requirements. For example, if the Maker invents a (Hydra) Cosmic Cube, you get to put it into your hand. But you still can’t play it unless you have a character with the Hydra team affiliation on your side.

# Mandarin
## [Mandarin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu1-046.jpg) (Photo)
^CardNumber: ^MCU1-046

*Set: The MCU Battles*  

Mandarin is really three potential characters in one. If Mandarin is in your deck you’ll need to bring your **Behind the Camera** pile with you which includes two copies of **Trevor Slattery** and one copy of **The Ten Rings**. When Mandarin gets KO’d, you’ll remove him from the game, shuffle your Behind the Camera pile, and randomly put one of the three cards there into your hand. 

This represents who Mandarin really is – lowly actor or deadly warlord. Leave the Behind the Camera pile face down – it’s important that your opponent doesn’t find out who the Mandarin really is until you’re ready to show them.

Q: If a character with **Rebirth** gets KO’d by the Uniqueness rules (i.e. I play a second copy of Mantis) can I still use her Rebirth power?

A: Yes.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

---

Q: If an opponent steals my Mantis (using Professor X) and then she gets KO’d, who gets to use her **Rebirth** effect?

A: Whoever currently controls the card gets to choose whether to use the **Rebirth** effect. However, she can only be placed in the Resource Row of her owner. In the example, that will be you.

Q: If an MC targeted by "You Are Destined to Die" leaves play, does it negate that ability?

A: Yes, modifiers by default cannot track characters that leave play. The removal from play will remove delayed triggered modifiers on them in the same way Nick fury loses the Infinity formula trigger if he were to be removed from play and returned.

# [Mastermind](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV2-014.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^CV2-014

*Set: Crossover vol. 2*  

When Mastermind appears, you'll create a Tactics pile made of any number of other Masterminds you have in your deck and hand. (Note: You don't have to put every Mastermind from your hand and/or deck into your Tactics pile.) Tactics piles are public. When Mastermind gets attacked, you may choose to play a random card from your Tactics pile. If you do, follow the instructions under its Tactic. Then put the card into your KO pile. When Mastermind leaves play, you'll leave your Tactics pile where it is. A player can only have one Tactics pile at a time. Later, if Mastermind appears on your side again, and you can (and want to) add more Tactics from your hand or deck, add them to your existing Tactics pile. Note: One of Mastermind's Tactics sets an attacker's ATK to 0 this combat. That character can still gain ATK later in the combat.

# [Match](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-013.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^TUB-013

*Set: The Utopia Battles*

Q: If Match strikes a Defender does he *only* put -1 counters on someone, or does he do counters *and* strike simultaneously?

A: When he strikes a Defender, his strike *is* the -1/-1 counters. These are applied during combat resolution. So, let's say that his opponent is 4/4 and is in position to strike back. Both Match and the Defender would strike simultaneously. The Defender hits with 4/4, Match hits with his counters (which haven't yet resolved). Match would be stunned by the strike back, and then the Defender would be reduced to 0/0 with the counters and would also be stunned.

Q: Match's ability says, "If Match would strike a defender, put -1/-1 counters equal to his ATK on that defender instead." Does that mean this ability only applies when Match is attacking? (Not when he is striking back as a defender.)

A: Correct.

# [Mattie Franklin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/WEB-011.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^WEB-011

*Set: Webheads*  

If Mattie is in your deck you can bring a Gift pile, which must include one of each of the five Gifts: Death, Immortality, Knowledge, Madness, and Power. When Mattie uses **The Gathering of Five** choose five different characters on  your side with different names. At least one of these characters must be one of your Main Characters. Then randomly assign one of the five Gifts to each of them. If you don't have at least five characters on your side with different names (or you don't have a Main Character on your side), Mattie can't use **The Gathering of Five**.

The Gift of Death will instantly KO its assigned character. The other four grant new abilities to their assigned characters (some good, some bad). Gift cards are not actually in play. Their cards are just play aids to remind everyone what new abilities each character has gained. If a character leaves play its Gift will no longer affect them (even if that character reenters play).

Q: Can a defending character locked down by Medusa be replaced in the combat & moved with Uncanny Defense or Spiderman MC?

A: The Defender will be replaced with a new defender but the switching of places is defined as a move so they will both stay where they are because if one of the characters can't move for a switch, neither will.

At your own risk, you may offer a **Deal with the Devil**. Here's how it works:

* The **Deal** must involve at least two elements.  
    * For example, the offer can't be "I draw ten cards."  
* There can only be one offer for the **Deal** - this is a "take it or leave it" situation.  
    * Mephisto hates negotiation.  
* The **Deal** can only involve game effects.  
    * For example, you can't offer money.  
* The **Deal** must be able to resolve immediately.  
    * Nothing that affects later turns or games.  
* All parts of the **Deal** must resolved simultaneously.  

Here are a few exemplar **Deals**:  

 -  "I draw five cards an you draw ten cards."  
 - "Wound your main character and put a supporting character from your hand onto your side."  
 - "You choose a character on your side and a character on my side and we stun them both."  
 - "I discard my hand and you lose the game."

Q: Does **Hypnotism** affect all enemy characters, or just the ones in-play when the power was activated?

A few things about these Plot Twists and Special Locations.

* They are not super powers.  
* Your main characters must be face up to pay for them.  
* Your main characters can use a "Wild" Special Location from their team to pay for them.  
* These cards are neutral, so just like any other neutral cards, they can be in Loyalty decks.  
* The Special Locations don't count as location swith a specific power symbol (for powers like Black Widow Main Character's Level Up power **Red in Her Ledger** or ZZutak's **Paint to Life**).

*Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.*  

[This card has received significant errata.](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rulings#wiki_mimic)

---

Previously the Absorption History pile included any three main characters with different names. Going forward, his Absorption History pile may only include the original five X-Men plus Professor X. This change reduces the number of main characters Mimic can copy, which avoids overpowered interactions. It also brings Mimic more in line with his classic flavor. This change is effective October 1st, 2020.

Below are the updated rules. (This replaces the rules entry in the H.A.M.M.E.R. Issue rules insert.) The changes are underlined.

---

**Mimic**

Mimic’s Absorption History, from his **Checkered Past** Keyword,  represents three characters that he’s copied powers from. In game terms it’s a pile that includes exactly three Main Character cards, one Level 1, one Level 2, and one Level 3. They can only be from the Illustrated Universe,  they must be Marvel and they must have three different card titles from the following list:

-   Angel
-   Beast
-   Cyclops
-   Iceman
-   Jean Grey
-   Professor X

Note: There is no main character with the card title Beast. Yet.

“Card title” refers to the name at the top of the card. It does not include additional names granted via  **AKA**.

At the time of this writing (September 2020), your choices at each level are:

Level 1: Angel, Cyclops (2 options), Iceman, Jean Grey, Professor X (2 options)

Level 2: Cyclops (2 options), Iceman, Jean Grey, Professor X (2 options)

Level 3: Jean Grey, Professor X

**Note:** While Mimic  _can_  copy Professor X’s Level 3  **Graduation**  super power, he won’t actually be able to  **Graduate**  any X-Men. (This is because the Graduation super power requires a Graduation pile, and you only get to bring a Graduation pile if Professor X is your main character, not if Professor X’s power is being copied. Look for an upcoming rules update that clarifies how out-of-game piles work.)

During setup when you reveal Mimic as your Main Character, you’ll also reveal the Level 1 character in your Absorption History. Mimic gains its Keyword and Super Powers only when the game begins.

When Mimic becomes Level 2, you’ll reveal the Level 2 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Power and loses the powers of the Level 1 character he was previously copying.

When Mimic becomes Level 3, you’ll reveal the Level 3 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Powers and loses the powers of the Level 2 character he was previously copying.

**Note:**  While  **Checkered Past** is a Keyword and can technically be turned off by certain effects, turning it off doesn’t affect Mimic’s ability to use the pile (it’s locked in from the beginning of the game).

Q: When using whichever lvl character from the **Absorption History** pile, which team affiliation does one use: Mimic's (H.A.M.M.E.R.) or the absorption power character's team?  

A: Mimic gains their powers, not team affiliations. Mimic is H.A.M.M.E.R. - it doesn't matter what his absorb guy is for any reason. That card isn't even technically in play.

^CardNumber: ^FAN-033, ^FAN-044

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Mole Man can **Tunnel** beneath enemy resources. If there are any enemy Locations, he must tunnel under those first. If there are none, he can tunnel under a face-down resource. When he **Tunnels**, remove him from the game and place him beneath the card he is tunneling under. At the start of your next turn, put him back onto your side and if the card he was under was a Location, turn it face down. If it was already face down, KO it.

If he is beneath a Location and it gets turned face down (including by being used for a super power) or leaves play, put him into your back row. If he is beneath a face-down resource and it leaves play, put him into your back row.

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*

Q: Which side does Moloid check to determine the ATK boost?

A: Though it's not totally clear, "that" refers to the opponent against whom you were attacking. So if you had 3 face down resources and your opponent had 5, Moloid would get +5 ATK when it attacked.

# [Monarch](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/OGA-013.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^OGA-013

*Set: The Omegas*  

**Pull On Quantum Strings** means you can have Equipment, characters, and Plot Twists (non-locations) face up in your resource row and during your Resource Step you can play a non-location face up as a resource. Characters on your side can use these non-locations to pay for their Super Power, regardless of their required power symbols. 

Example: You have Monarch and the X-men Cyclops Supporting Character on  your side. Cyclops can use any of the non-locations face up in your resource row to pay for his **Battle Tactics** Super Power. He can still use School for Gifted Youngsters and Training Grounds to pay for the Battle Tactics normally.

These non-locations can't be used for any other purpose.

When Monarch leaves your side, or if **Pull On Quantum Strings** gets turned off, turn each face up non-location card in your resource row face down.

^CardNumber: ^DAR-005, ^DAR-006

*Set: Into the Darkness*

**The Hunger** lets Morbius melee attack characters in his own front row. In order to do so, Morbius must be ready and in the front row, and then he will exhaust to start the combat. It works just like a normal combat, except the attacker and defender are both on the same side and don't count as being enemies to each other. During the combat, each player can play Plot Twists (perhaps to cancel the combat) then each character will strike each other. If Morbius KO's the defender and survives, his **Vampire** power will give him a vitality counter.

^CardNumber: ^PRD-007, ^PRD-008

*Set: The Predator Battles*  

**Enhanced Bio-Mask** 
Mr. Black’s super power allows him to attack a face-down (hidden or stunned) character. Treat it as a regular attack (both players can play Plot Twists, Power-Up, etc.), but keep in mind the face-down character’s powers are turned off and its Team Affiliation is not available for things like playing a Plot Twist. 

When Mr. Black and the defender strike each other:  
* Mr. Black can get stunned as normal.  
* A hidden character can get stunned as normal. (Wound it and change its orientation from ready to exhausted.)  
* If Mr. Black’s strike would stun an already-stunned character, wound it instead. Note: A stunned character can’t be stunned (including by having its DEF reduced to 0 or a direct “stun” effect).

Q: Does "Even the Odds" impact \*Ms. Marvel\*? Her power allows you to pitch a card and her "Base ATK and DEF" change. Even the Odds changes a chosen character back to their base.

Does Kamala's power avoid being touched by Even the Odds?

A: Even the Odds will remove and +1/+1 counters from \*Ms. Marvel\*, but yes she "avoids being touched" by Even the Odds' effect that resets a character to their base ATK/DEF because her power changes her base ATK/DEF.

Q: Put another way, is the intent of Even the Odds to return a card to its *printed* stats? Or is it worded with the intent that cards that change their base stats can get around the effect?

A: Yes, cards that change their Base stats get around Even the Odds' "reset" effect.

**You Don't Want Any Part of This** puts a Supporting Character with the **Hologram** keyword from your hand onto an enemy side. Why do this? Because when that **Hologram** get's KO'd, Mysterio will level up.

**I Don't Think You Know What's Real** can turn any Supporting Character in your hand into a **Hologram**. For example, if Mysterio pays an ![](%%Energy%%)  (Energy) you could put a Thanos Supporting Character from your hand onto your side. Thanos would gain the ![](%%Energy%%)  (Energy) **Hologram** keyword and appear with two wounds (because he has 3 Health).

Mysterio can use his special effects expertise to make any plot twist seem like a (Sinister Syndicate) plot twist. Here are the two in this set:

* Putting the Team Together  
* Sinister Six

When you play a plot twist as a copy of a (Sinister Syndicate) plot twist, ignore everything that’s printed on it, and pretend you just played one of the (Sinister Syndicate) plot twists. You can use any plot twist this way, regardless of its printed team affiliation or timing restriction.

^CardNumber: ^AFF-033, ^LEG-066, ^LEG-067

*Set: Legacy*  

**Identity Theft**  
Mystique’s super power allows her to transform into a different Level 2 Main Character. When she does this, remove her from the game and put the new character into play in the same orientation (ready/exhausted) she was in. Move all counters from her onto the new character, applying any effects (such as Freeze) to the new character. 

Playing with friends, you can choose to transform into any character in your collection, but if you’re playing in a tournament, you must select three Main Character options when you build your deck. You must set them face-down next to your unused Level 2/Level 3 characters. (You don’t need to show them to your opponent.)

Q: If she is lvl 1 and has one -1/-1 counter on her and attacks lvl2 She-Hulk (6/6) and uses **Masquerade**, does she gain +6 ATK and +6 XP?

A: Yes, you clever Monkey.

^(Source: FB Community Post)

Q: Ok, what if she has three -1/-1 counters on her, giving her basically -2 Attack and she gains +4 ATK making her have 2 ATK; does she gain 4 XP or 2 XP?

A: 4 XP . From the rule book: ATK values that are below 0 are treated as 0 except when trying to raise or lower them. In the latter case, always use the real value.

^(Source: FB Post - Kirk)

---

Q: Does adding counters count as her gaining ATK? What about Trickster God switching her ATK/DEF, would she gain 5 xp as she turns into a 6/1?

A: Yes and Yes.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

---

Q: Mystique and Green Goblin are out; Mystique attacks and uses her power to give her 4 ATK and she has enough to level up. Does she keep those 3 ATK she took from green goblin to make her a 9/7?

A: Yes. The vast majority of the time, the results of a resolving effect are "locked in" at resolution and even if the situation later changes, the modifier still applies. The only exception is if they use the word "While" which mean it is continuously looking for a specific variable to be true or false.  
  
Since this does not use "While" we know it is locked in at resolution. As long as the duration has not expired, any modifier affecting the Lvl 1 Mystique will continue to affect the Lvl 2 Mystique.  
  
In the example given by the OP, the +3 ATK gained by her Super Power would continue to apply after she is level 2.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

Q: With **Masquerade**, Does Mystique gain that character’s base ATK, or their current attack including counters/modifiers/etc?

For example, if Spider Ham attacks Mystique while Madame Web is in his side, giving him 8/4, and Mystique uses masquerade, does she gain attack up to 6 (since this is spider ham’s base ATK) or does she gain attack up to 8 (since he has +2/+2 from madame web)? So would she gain 5 XP or  7 XP?

A: Mystique matches power including all modifiers, so she’d gain 7 attack. It would say “printed attack” if it worked the other way.

With **The Perfect Metamorph**, you may choose a face-down character. If the chosen character would get stunned by  **The Perfect Metamorph**  but it’s already stunned, nothing else happens. (Neither it nor Mystique get stunned.) If the chosen character is no longer in play when Mystique would be stunned, Mystique gets stunned normally.

Keep in mind, the effect from  **The Perfect Metamorph**  lasts until Mystique gets stunned. If it allows her to avoid getting stunned, the effect remains active. In other words, a single use of the power could prevent several stuns to Mystique.

Even if  **The Perfect Metamorph**  is active, Mystique can use it again to change her name and affiliations, and to have a different enemy character become her new potential stun replacement.

Note: If Mystique takes the name of a unique character with the same name as a supporting character on your side, that supporting character will get KO’d.

A: Nothing. Mystique locks in whatever that character’s current ATK and DEF are as her Base ATK and DEF for the turn. If they change later it doesn’t affect her.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

Q: What happens if Mystique has any +1/+1 counters when I use Impersonate?

A: Apply the +1/+1s after her stats change. For example, let’s say she has two +1/+1 counters and she Impersonate’s a 4/7 character. She’ll become 4/7 with two +1/+1 counters for an end result of 6/9.

**Editor's note:** As of the [August 2021 rules update](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2021/08/vs-system-2pcg-rules-update-august-2021/), there is a slight clarification here. If Nebula would be granted a power by the equipment (such as if the equipment says, "Equipped character has  ![](%%Flight%%)  (Flight)"), the above note still applies. However, other powers on the equipment remain on the equipment and aren't actually granted to the equipped character. See [this article for further clarification](https://www.thebuildphasenetwork.com/articleblog/digesting-2021-equip-rules).

Editor's note: Some of the following information below can be confusing out of context of the [August 2021 Rules update](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2021/08/vs-system-2pcg-rules-update-august-2021/).

> The Nullifier's effect can be Nullified by effects that turn off keyword powers and if it changes sides it will target the updated "enemy characters" as the affected target(s).

This was clarified in July 2019 that many people were playing this card incorrectly. We originally believed this card to work in a way that made Nullifier's effect independent of the card itself, so it could not be Nullified. Essentially that the effect and targets would be unchanged until the card left the play zone, even if it swapped sides or got targeted by Cosmo or another Nullifier.

^(Source: UDE official clarification)

> The Nullifier only affect powers that resolve in the play zone.

This was clarified in July 2019 that the Nullifier will have no effects on powers that resolve before they appear such as Dark Phoenix SC who has a "When you recruit Dark Phoenix" trigger. Recruiting happens before appearing so it cannot be stopped with the Nullifier. This is also true of cards that have effects that will resolve from your hand such as Shadowcat SC's Intagible Escape. You can still name a power that is not in play yet, but Nullifier will only act upon that power once the card is in play and some effects will resolve before that point.

^(Source: UDE official clarification)

---

To explain the above differently:

First, the Nullifier does two things: A triggered power when it appears (you name a thing); then, a continuous power that keeps the named thing turned off.

Because this is now classified as a continuous modifier it means that it will impact characters played after the Nullifier entered play.

It also means that when Grid steals a Nullifier it continues to work, targeting *enemy* characters. This turns the Nullifier against the player who played it.

However, as of the [August 2021 Rules update](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2021/08/vs-system-2pcg-rules-update-august-2021/), because Equipment powers are no longer all granted to the equipped character, you can no longer target **Ultimate Nullification** with another Nullifier, Cosmo, or any other card that specifically targets powers on characters.

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Because this copies everything from any enemy Plot Twist you choose except for that Plot Twist's team affiliations (and it technically keeps its (Fearsome) team affiliation, you must only have a face up (Fearsome) character on your side in order to play this Plot Twist.

# [Odin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MCU6-004.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MCU6-004

*Set: Space & Time*  

Odin introduces **Level Down Powers** to the game. A Level Down Power works just like a Level Up Power, except instead of gaining XP which advances it to a higher level, it gains XP which regresses it back to a lower level. When a character gains Level Down XP, put an XP counter on its Main character card that is one level lower than its current level. If a character has both a Level Up and a Level Down Power, it's possible for it to gain and have both kinds of XP. However, once it levels up or levels down, all of both types of XP will be removed.

Here's an example of how Odin works:

Odin actually starts off as his most powerful self at Level 1. but after a few turns of gaining power through **The Odinforce** (or other means) he'll level up and then take a nap. While he's asleep he can gain both Level Down XP and Level Up XP. If he gets two Level Down XP, he'll wake up and level down back to Level 1, and both kinds of his XP will be removed. But if he gets two Level Up XP instead, he'll level up to Level 3 and realize his time has come.

These are four different One of a Kind Equipment that have the same name. Unlike characters, Equipment are not unique so you can have any number with same name in play at the same time. Because these have the (H.A.M.M.E.R.) symbol, you must have a face-up character in order to play them.

This card has received errata in the [August 2021 Rules update](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2021/08/vs-system-2pcg-rules-update-august-2021/) and now reads:

> When you recruit Onslaught, each player reveals cards from the top of their deck until they reveal a character other than Onslaught. Remove those characters from the game and shuffle the remaining cards into those decks. Onslaught has the printed powers of the removed cards and base stats equal to their total printed ATK, total printed DEF, and total printed [Health].

---

**Joint Consciousness**  
Onslaught’s power occurs when you pay to recruit him, but before he appears. This way he will trigger any “appears” powers on cards he removed from the game.

^(Source: Rule insert)

---

Q: What happens when Onslaught comes back from Singularity's **Pocket Dimension**? Does he keep the ATK/DEF and Health he gained from when he was recruited?

A: If he is removed from the game and comes back, he is a 0/0 with 0 health. The Modifier created by **Joint Consciousness** can not track him between zones, so once he leaves play, it no longer applies. When he comes back into play, **Joint Consciousness** will not trigger.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel)

---

Q: What happens if I **Nullify** Onslaught with Cosmo?

A: Cosmo prevents powers from working, it does NOT stop modifiers from applying to a character. Once **Joint Consciousness** has resolved and established the base stats, using Cosmo on him will NOT change that. It will only suppress any powers he may have gained.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel)

Q: What happens if Onslaught has a +1/+1 counter and is moved to Singularity's **Pocket Dimension**. He comes back as 1/1 with 0 Health, is he stunned?

A: He would still be stunned since he will have wounds equal to his health (0 is equal to 0).

# [Parallel Dimension](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-064.jpg)

A **Duplicate** of your Main Character works like this. It has all the same printed characteristics as your Main Character - name, team, current Level, and powers - plus it has **Swarm** and it can't gain XP, Level Up or Level Down, transform, or otherwise become a different card. (**Editor's note**: There is a typo in the rule insert that states that this copy also has the original's ATK/DEF. That is incorrect. It is a 0/1 copy.) When it's KO'd, it will go back to being the Parallel Dimension Plot Twist in your KO Pile.

Note: If you have more than one Main Character when you play this, choose one to make a **Duplicate** of.

Scenario: I make a **Duplicate** of Level 2 **The First Evil** and then play **Appear As The Dead** to play a character from a KO pile. Can I just keep doing this as I would with the actual **The First Evil**?

A: No. You **can** do this the first time. However, as soon as **Parallel Dimension** leaves play, it ceases to be a character and turns back into a plot twist. At that point, it "forgets" that it was a character and is never able to reenter play.

^CardNumber: ^TUB-008, ^TUB-009

*Set: The Utopia Battles*  

**Souldagger** causes a character to lose each modifier it gained during combat. A modifier is an effect that modifies the game. There are two types of modifiers – 

A one-shot modifier does something immediately and then is done. Example: “Put two +1/+1 counters on a character.”

 A continuous modifier has an ongoing effect on the game, which may or may not have a duration. Example: “Choose a character to get +2/+0 and **Lethal** this combat.” 
 
When Pixie uses **Souldagger**, it will cause an enemy character to lose any continuous modifiers that are applying to it. (It won’t stop any one-shot modifiers because it’s impossible for there to be any one-shot modifiers happening while you use **Souldagger**.) 

**Half-Fairy** will give Pixie an XP when any character (including an enemy) pays an ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy). This includes when a character uses an ![](%%Energy%%) (Engergy) Super Power, or choosing to spend an ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy) when you play the Plot Twist **Sacred Ground**.

A: Pixie's effect becomes independent of Pixie once it brings Adam into play. So if Adam is in play at End of Turn, he will be KO'ed.

# [Power Man](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/DFX-017.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^DFX-017

*Set: The New Defenders*  

Some characters are known by more than one moniker - like Power Man, who says **AKA Luke Cage**. He counts as having both names, which means you can use a Luke Cage supporting character to Power Up Power Man, and vice versa. It also means they both count as the same person for the purposes of the Uniqueness rules.

Power Man loves a good party, especially if he wasn’t invited. His **Crash the Party** power counts each enemy power, even if there are multiple instances of the same power. But remember face-down characters lose their powers so he won’t count their powers.

Q: If Prof X MC uses **Mental Domination** to take control of Sister Grimm MC and suicides her, does she level up?

A: The default point of reference is always the controller. The controller in this case is the Professor X player. And it is during his turn and if he suicides Sister Grimm MC, it is NOT the "enemy's turn."

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel)

Q: Can I steal a Main Character with **Mental Domination**?

A: Yes. You control that character for the whole turn as though it were your own. If it gets stunned, it takes a wound as normal. If that wound would KO it, it gets KO’d as normal and that player is out of the game. It can even gain XP and level up, but we would recommend against doing that for your opponent.

*Set: New Mutants*  

In this set the Professor gets a whole new main character, and this time he goes up to Level 3. (Note: This new Professor X can’t level up into the old one from The Marvel Battles set and vice versa. A main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork as it does.) 

Professor X’s **Graduation** power lets you turn an (X-Men) supporting character into the main character version of that character. (Once it’s become a main character it can level up normally. Professor X is a really good teacher.)

This allows you to have any number of main characters in play at once. However, Professor X is still your MAIN main character – if he gets KO’d you’ll lose the game. (Your other main characters getting KO’d won’t cause you to lose the game.)

# [Proteus](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/OGA-014.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^OGA-014

*Set: The Omegas*  

Proteus is technically a Supporting Character but he doesn't want to actually be in play. He prefers to have a physical host. If he would be recruited, you'll remove him from the game instead and choose a face-up character on your side to be his Host. If you don't have a face-up character, Proteus will still be removed from the game. When his Host gets stunned or leaves play Proteus will no longer have a Host, but he does remain removed from the game.

If Proteus would appear any other way except by being recruited, he will be stunned and KO'd because he has zero DEF.

^(Source: Rule insert)

---
Scenario: An enemy character is Proteus' host. I recruit Dark Phoenix and remove Keywords from the game.

Q: Does the +10/+10 remain on the character because Proteus' **Reality Warping** has been already activated and now Proteus is no longer in the game?

A: Reality Warping is a Keyword that grants a Super Power. If Dark Phoenix calls Keywords the entire Keyword is removed including the Super Power ability. If Dark Phoenix calls Super Powers only the Super Power ability of Reality Warping is removed. (Mark from Upper Deck)

Said another way, since a keyword granted all these powers and boosts, if keyword text is removed as a concept then it is like the keyword never existed in the first place.

Q: Can I use Boomerang (for example) to remove keyword powers from Proteus's host, and thereby remove the effects from the **Reality Warping** power?

A: No. **Reality Warping** isn't granted to the host as a keyword power, per se. It is a keyword power on Proteus (who has now been removed from game). The effect granted to the host is considered a modifier, so it isn't removed by effects that remove powers. See the post about Shadow King below for a comparable ruling.

A: Yes. Each copy of Punisher 2099 that is used to power up grants an additional wound. So if you powered him up with two copies, it would grant two additional wounds; three total - one for the attack and two for the two copies discarded to power up.

You can use this Gem to turn cards in play face up. If you choose a stunned character this counts as recovering it. If you choose a hidden character, it counts as un-hiding it.

(It should be revealed to each player to prove that it's not a location). 

You can also use the Gem to turn cards in play face down. If you do this to a ready character, it counts as hiding it. If you do it to an exhausted character, it counts as dazing it (i.e. stun it but it doesn't gain a wound). 

If you do it to an equipment, that equipment will stay equipped but its powers are temporarily turned off. It will turn face up again when the characters on that side would recover. If you do it to a location or face-up Infinity Gem, it will turn face down.

Q: How does **Dust of Death** work?

A: It will stun one character that is melee attacking the Red Skull. If that was the only attacker in the combat, the combat will be canceled.

# Rhino

^CardNumber: ^CV1-013

*Set: Crossover*  

**Headlong Charge**  
Rhino “Sidestep” means that the defender stays where it is, but avoids Rhino just enough. The defender doesn’t count as moving. When an enemy front row character sidesteps, you’ll get to pick a new defender in their back row. If there aren’t any, the combat will end. Sorry Rhino!

## [Rhino](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-039.jpg) (Underworld)
^CardNumber: ^DEF-039

*Set: The Defenders*  

Daredevil and Rhino have effects that allow an enemy player to spend a ![](%%Skill%%) (Skill) or ![](%%Intellect%%) (Intellect) to do something. In this case, they can use a Training Ground or Academy to pay for the effect, but not a special Location like Fisk Tower.

# [Ripley #8](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/ALN-007.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^ALN-007, ^ALN-008

*Set: The Alien Battles*

Q: How does Ripley #8's **Acidic Blood** interact with Dagger? 

A: The short answer is this:

 1. When you trigger her ability, you still have to choose a number of -1/-1 counters that would not reduce her DEF to 0.
 2. At this point, Dagger's ability takes effect. If you have Defenders Dagger, the -1/-1 counters are simply not added to Ripley. If you have H.A.M.M.E.R. or Anti-Registration Dagger, then those counters are replaced with +1/+1 counters on Ripley or Dagger respectively.
 3. Because the -1/-1 counters never actually hit Ripley, the "Then put that many counters on an enemy supporting character" never gets to trigger.

# [Roberta](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HER-010.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^HER-010

*Set:  The Herald*  

**Receptionist** prevents Roberta from leaving the front row. This means she can't be moved to the back row during your Formation Step, and she ignores any card effects that would move her out of the front row. However, an effect could move her from one player's front row to another player's front row.

*Set: The X-Files Battles*

**Pusher** affects the next enemy player's Formation Step. You can either force that player to put their Range characters into their front row or their characters without Range into their back row.

**Note:** You must choose which option you want when you use **Pusher**, not during the enemy player's Formation Step.

When **Kitsunegari** moves an enemy character to your side, you may immediately have it use one of its **Main** Super Powers without paying its power symbols. Then whether it used one of its powers or not, it goes back to the same row and position it was in. If it used one of its powers, then it won't be able to use that power again this turn. (Unless that power can normally be used multiple times on a turn.)

*Set: The Boys*   

Granting 1 XP to a supporting character or a main character at its highest level won't do anything. (So give them a +1/+1 counter instead.)

# Rocket
## [Rocket](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-053.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: ^MNB-053, ^MNB-054

**Set: The Marvel Battles**

Q: Will his **Back Against the Wall** power trigger if I have no cards for a moment in the middle of resolving an effect? For example, if I use Emma Frost’s **Mind Games** on myself?

A: No. You have to have no cards after the effect has finished resolving.

Q: Can I discard a ![](%%Skill%%) (Skill) location to activate **One Raccoon’s Garbage** and then randomly get it back with that power?

A: Yes. If you’re lucky enough.

Q: Does Rocket Level up when Thanos's **The Infinity Gauntlet** makes him discard his hand?

A: No. In order; Rocket is stunned first, then later discards and then draws on their turn before Rocket recovers. So at no point when Rocket is face up does he have no cards in hand.

*Set: The MCU Battles*  

Rocket’s **I’m Gonna Need a Few Things** power requires you to choose two cards with different names in your KO pile. If you don’t have two cards with two different names, his power will have no effect.

# Rogue
## [Rogue](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/RES-005.jpg) (MC - Resistance)
*Set: Resistance*  

Note that if she Powers Up while Level 1 or 2, Rogue will gain an XP. Also, her **Force Transfer** and **Life Transfer** will each give her 2 XP when they are used.

## [Rogue (SC - Brotherhood)](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FRE-013.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FRE-013, ^FRE-014

*Set: Freedom Force*

**Permanent Power Absorption** works like this: Rogue gains an ATK, DEF, and Health increase equal to the KO'd character's printed ATK, DEF, and Health respectively. She also gains that character's printed keyword and super powers. These gains last until Rogue leaves play.

However, once Rogue absorbs the stats and powers from a character, she loses **Permanent Power Absorption**.

^CardNumber: ^AFF-021

*Set: A-Force*  

**Absorb Powers**  
Rogue has the ability to gain the keyword and super powers of supporting characters she’s KO’d. When she does this, if that character’s power refers to its own name, use Rogue’s name instead.

Q: If I team attack with Star-Lord (sc) Gamora (sc) and Rogue, I know Gamora **Lethal** will KO the defender, but will Rogue gain the powers of the defender since it's is a **Lethal** trigger from Gamora KOing the defender?

A: Yes. **Lethal** is no longer a trigger. It changes the wound given in combat to a lethal wound. Since this is a KO by combat, all team attackers get credit for the KO, including Rogue.

Q: If I KO my opponent's Hope Summers with Rogue and he has a Beast in play, will my Rogue also gain the Genius keyword until she is stunned or removed from play?

A: No, Rogue will only gain the *printed* powers of Hope.

Q: If Rogue KO's Madame Masque, can I power up Rogue and put the discarded Rogue into play?

A: Yes, Rogue's Absorb Power gains all of Madam's powers and replaces all instances of Madam's Name with her own, so she gains this power. The second copy of Rogue in play is not KO'd because the first copy also absorbed the **Swarm** power.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

Q: Ok, so now I have two Rogues in play (via Madame Masque as mentioned above); if the first one with **Swarm** is Stunned does she lose **Swarm** and do I lose the second copy to uniqueness?

A: While the stunning itself would NOT remove **Swarm**, that is not relevant here. The modifier that gives Rogue **Swarm** has a duration that only lasts UNTIL she is stunned. So when she is stunned, the modifier stops giving her **Swarm**, and you will need to apply the uniqueness rule if relevant.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

Q: Alright, so what if the first Rogue with **Swarm** gets Nullified by Cosmo, doesn't she lose **Absorb** which would in turn make her lose **Swarm**?

A: **Swarm** is still there as nothing can remove **Swarm**. **Absorb** is now gone so she can not "absorb" any new powers, but any previously created modifiers (like the one giving her **Swarm**) are still there.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

Q: If I have 3 copies of Rogue in play, and only 1 of them has **Swarm** and that copy gets KO'd, would you need to KO another one to account for Uniqueness?

A: Yes.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

Q: If I have 3 copies of Rogue in play and the one with **Swarm** is stunned, causing a Uniqueness situation, which ones are KO'd and which one stays in play?

A: The most recently played one stays in play.

Q: Can Rogue gain multiple instances of the same power?

A: Rogue can get the same power twice. Sometimes it will be redundant (![](%%Flight%%)/**Range**/**[Fearless](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_fearless)**/**Mobile**/**Shrink**) and give no benefit, but sometimes it will give additional benefit (**Berserker**/Appear Triggers/Super Powers). In the case of super powers, each copy of the power is distinct and each can be used once per turn.

**We’re Going to Kill Them All**  
Royce’s supporting character has this Super Power. It allows him to move a wound from an enemy character (even an enemy Main Character) to an enemy Supporting Character. The characters must be different. The first character counts as being healed and the second character counts as being wounded.

# [The Runner](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV2-008.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^CV2-008

*Set: Crossover vol. 2*  

The Runner is so fast he can actually attack during your Build Phase. This means you can recruit characters and equipment after the Runner attacks. (You could even recruit a new copy of Runner and attack with it!) Note: The Runner attacking during the Build Phase does count as a regular Combat so **Combat** Super Powers and Plot Twists, and power ups can be used during a Build Phase combat. However, during the combat you can't use any **Build** Super Powers and Plot Twists.
