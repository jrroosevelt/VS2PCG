# Game modes

In addition to the traditional game, there are some additional game modes (not to be confused with formats). Many of the game modes below were introduced in the January 2021 "Crossover Volume 3" issue.

# Battleworld
Number of players: 2

Battleworld is a patchwork planet created by various cosmic entities over the years with various lands, or Domains, on it. There are 12 Battleworld Domains in this Issue.

**Setup**: Shuffle 12 different random Battleworld Domains and place them face down in a pile between the players. Do the same with a set of the 10 Terrain - City cards. (One Domain uses them.)

**Rules**: When a defending Main Character gets wounded, reveal the top Battleworld Domain. The game “enters” this Domain, meaning its effects are now applicable. The game will stay in that Domain until the next time a defending Main Character gets wounded, then the game will “leave” the current Battleworld Domain and enter the next one. (Put the older Domain into a discard pile next to the pile, and reveal the top card of the pile to be the new Domain.) The game can only be in one Domain at a time. If the Domain pile ever runs out, shuffle the discard pile, and make a new pile. Domains aren’t “in play” and can’t be affected by cards or effects.

# Boss Battle
Number of players: 3

Previously, in the Monsters Unleashed set, we introduced the 2 vs. 1 “Leviathon Invasion” mode. We have expanded this way to play with five Boss Battles: the Leviathon Mother (updated), as well as Death, Fin Fang Foom, Thanos, and Ultron.

**Setup**: One player will play as the Boss. They choose one of the five Bosses as their main character. (They can play any main character with that name, from either the Photographic or Illustrated Universe.) They take the associated Boss Battle card as a reference and build their deck as normal. The other two players choose any main characters as normal (except they can’t choose the Boss player’s main character) and also build their decks as normal.

**Rules**: Boss Battles use the “Free for All” game rules with the following changes:

-   The Boss goes first, then play proceeds clockwise. No players skip drawing cards during their first Draw Phase.
-   When a basic location appears on the Boss player’s side, they get the related effect from its power symbol, as instructed on their Boss Battle card.
-   When a special location named on the Boss Battle card appears on the Boss player’s side, they get the related effect.
-   The Boss player only wins by KOing the other two players’ Main Characters.
-   The other two players only win by KOing the Boss.
