# Game modes

In addition to the traditional game, there are some additional game modes (not to be confused with [formats](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/events)). Many of the game modes below were introduced in the January 2021 "Crossover Volume 3" issue.

# Battleworld
**Number of players:** 2

Battleworld is a patchwork planet created by various cosmic entities over the years with various lands, or Domains, on it. There are 12 Battleworld Domains in this Issue.

**Setup**: Shuffle 12 different random Battleworld Domains and place them face down in a pile between the players. Do the same with a set of the 10 Terrain - City cards. (One Domain uses them.)

**Rules**: When a defending Main Character gets wounded, reveal the top Battleworld Domain. The game “enters” this Domain, meaning its effects are now applicable. The game will stay in that Domain until the next time a defending Main Character gets wounded, then the game will “leave” the current Battleworld Domain and enter the next one. (Put the older Domain into a discard pile next to the pile, and reveal the top card of the pile to be the new Domain.) The game can only be in one Domain at a time. If the Domain pile ever runs out, shuffle the discard pile, and make a new pile. Domains aren’t “in play” and can’t be affected by cards or effects.

**Mix Battleworld with:** Story Mode, Terrain

# Boss Battle
**Number of players:** 3

Previously, in the Monsters Unleashed set, we introduced the 2 vs. 1 “Leviathon Invasion” mode. We have expanded this way to play with five Boss Battles: the Leviathon Mother (updated), as well as Death, Fin Fang Foom, Thanos, and Ultron.

**Setup**: One player will play as the Boss. They choose one of the five Bosses as their main character. (They can play any main character with that name, from either the Photographic or Illustrated Universe.) They take the associated Boss Battle card as a reference and build their deck as normal. The other two players choose any main characters as normal (except they can’t choose the Boss player’s main character) and also build their decks as normal.

**Rules**: Boss Battles use the “Free for All” game rules with the following changes:

-   The Boss goes first, then play proceeds clockwise. No players skip drawing cards during their first Draw Phase.
-   When a basic location appears on the Boss player’s side, they get the related effect from its power symbol, as instructed on their Boss Battle card.
-   When a special location named on the Boss Battle card appears on the Boss player’s side, they get the related effect.
-   The Boss player only wins by KOing the other two players’ Main Characters.
-   The other two players only win by KOing the Boss.

** Mix Boss Battles with:** Terrain

## Boss Battles Option: Boss vs. Boss
For a truly gargantuan fight, two players can each choose a Boss and throw down in a **Boss vs. Boss** Battle!

All other rules from Boss Battle remain the same, except you will need to randomize the first player, who *will* skip drawing cards during their first Draw Phase.

**Mix Boss vs. Boss with:** Battleworld, Story Mode, Terrain

# Terrain
**Number of players**: 2-4

Terrain is an important part of almost every combat. We thought we would make some!

**Setup**: Shuffle a set of 10 Terrain and place them face down in a pile. (As of this Issue, there is only one Terrain set: “City”.) After players reveal their main characters during setup, but before they draw their hands, each player draws a Terrain card and looks at it. Then the first player places their Terrain, with the rest of the players following in turn order. (Each Terrain will tell you which row it can be placed in. We suggest you turn it sideways in its row.) Then each player draws their hand and mulligans as normal.

**Rules**: Terrain either affects each character in a row or one or two characters in a row.

-   If a Terrain affects an entire row, its modifiers apply to each character in that row this game.
    -   A character can be affected by more than one Terrain of this type.
-   If a Terrain affects a specific amount of characters, during each player’s Formation Steps they can move the proper number of characters into or out of that Terrain. While a character is in that Terrain, its modifiers apply to those characters.
    -   Characters in this type of Terrain should be physically touching the Terrain card.
    -   You can leave this type of Terrain empty or partially full: you aren’t required to put characters in it.
    -   A character can’t be in more than one Terrain of this type. (But it could be affected by a Terrain that affects an entire row and in one that affects only one character.)

**Mix Terrain with:** Battleworld, Story Mode, Boss battle

## Terrain Option: Multi-draw
For more strategic gameplay, players can draw two Terrain cards (or more) during setup and choose the one they prefer.

# Story Mode
**Number of players:** 2

In Story Mode, players will play through a series of three games (called Parts) with the same decks, gaining an advantage for each game they win. And Part 3 is winner-take-all!

**Setup**: Choose a Story Mode card, either randomly or by consulting the “Story Complexity” list below, then choose a player to be Player A for the Story.

**Story Complexity**  (from least to most complex):

Death of a Loved One, Epic Quest, Time Traveler, Galactic Game, Assassination Plot

In some Stories, Player A has an advantage, and in some Player B has an advantage. You’ll discover the best one for your matchup of player skill and deck strength.

We suggest you first try Story Mode with decks you have already built, but you might want to build decks especially for particular Stories after you’ve tried them a few times.

**Rules**: Player A always goes first in Part 1, then the winner of each Part goes first in the next Part. After each Part is over, simply follow the directions on the Story Mode card for whichever player wins.

**Mix Story Mode with:** Battleworld, Terrain

## Story Mode Option: Storyline
Play a series of multiple Stories in a “Storyline”! Play them in a random order or choose an order that tells the best story for you! The winner of Part 3 of each Story becomes Player A for the next Story.

## Story Mode: Assassination Plot
### Part 1: Create the Plan
**Player A wins:** *You're able to scope out the layout of the enemy HQ.* For part 2 you start with two extra cards.

**Player B wins:** *You detect some lurking enemies, and raise the alert level.* Secretly name a supporting character in your deck to be a **Bodyguard** for the rest of the story.

### Part 2: Get Into Position
**Player A wins:** *Your plan is to attack from all angles.* Secretly name a character in your deck to be a **Deadly Assassin** and a supporting character in Player B's deck to be an **Infiltrator** for Part 3.

**Player B wins:** *You've repelled an attempt to turn your closest advisors. But the danger persists.* Player A secretly names a supporting character in their deck to be a **Deadly Assassin** for Part 3.

### Part 3: Execute the Plan
**Player A wins:** *You have eliminated a true fiend!*

**Player B Wins:** *You have defended your leader!*

### Assassination Plot clarifications
This story card grants secret powers that work like this:

#### Bodyguard
When a character attacks Player B's main character, Player B may remove that main character from combat and replace it with this character. If they do, switch their positions. 

The first time **Bodyguard** uses its power Player B must announce that it (and all copies of it they own) has **Bodyguard** while on Player B's side.

#### Deadly Assassin
While on Player A's side, if this character wounds a defending main character, KO that main character.

#### Infiltrator
Once per turn, during Player A's Main Phase but not during combat, Player A may have this character make a melee attack (from Player B's side) against a main character *in its row*.

Exhaust the **Infiltrator** to start the attack. (If it was exhausted, ready it first.) During the attack, it counts as being on PLayer A's side for the purposes of plot twists, super powers, and power ups.

If it wounds the defending main character, KO that main character. If it fails to wound the defending main character, KO the **Infiltrator**, the first time each of those characters attacks Player B's main character this game, Player A must announce that it (and all copies of it owned by the relevant player) has that power. This announcement happens before any effects (such as **Bodyguard**) trigger from starting the attack.

## Story Mode: Death of a Loved One
### Part 1: A Hole in Your Heart
**Player A wins:** *Did you go too far?* Choose a supporting character in Player B's KO pile. That character is dead for the rest of the story. *(Remove each copy of it from Player B's deck before part 2.)*

**Player B wins:** *You can't save everyone.* Same as above.

### Part 2: Get Into Position
**Player A wins:** *Your plan is to attack from all angles.* Secretly name a character in your deck to be a **Deadly Assassin** and a supporting character in Player B's deck to be an **Infiltrator** for Part 3.

**Player B wins:** *You've repelled an attempt to turn your closest advisors. But the danger persists.* Player A secretly names a supporting character in their deck to be a **Deadly Assassin** for Part 3.

### Part 3: Execute the Plan
**Player A wins:** *You have eliminated a true fiend!*

**Player B Wins:** *You have defended your leader!*


## Story Mode: Galactic Game
To build a **Patchwork Planet**, take nine locations - one of each of the six Basic types, one "wild" Special Location for each main character, and one random Special Location that doesn't produce power symbols (like Wakanda). (If a main character doesn't have a "wile" they choose a specific Basic Location.)

Shuffle the nine locations and deal them out into a face-up 3x3 grid to the side of the game. Each player puts a marker (try Wound and XP counters) on their "wild" location.

characters on your side can use the locations where you have a marker as if they were in your resource row. When a location is used this way, turn it face down. (Turn it face up at the start of the next Part.)

## Story Mode: Time Traveler
When you set up the game for Part 3, after both players are done mulliganing (if necessary), Player A puts the top ten or seven cards from their deck into their resource row. If any of these are locations, turn them face up.
