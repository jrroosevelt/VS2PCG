This Plot Twist can allow you to add an attacker to your attack. The attacker must be a face-up character on your side not already in the attack. Move the new attacker to the row from which the first attackers were attacking. It doesn't need to be ready to join the attack and doesn't exhaust when it's added to the attack and it ignores ![](%%Flight%%), ![](%%Range%%), and team restrictions for an attack.

You can still communicate in other ways such as using hand signals, or writing things down. You can also make sounds without using your vocal chords.

**You Can Borrow This for a While** grants characters with the chosen name the **Dimensional Wristwatch** keyword. You can recruit a character with **Dimensional Wristwatch** directly from your deck: Announce you're recruiting them from your deck, search your deck for the character, shuffle your deck, and then recruit them (pay its cost and put it onto your side). 

If a character with the chosen name gets put back into your deck somehow it will regain **Dimensional Wristwatch** while it's in your deck.

**Ticket to the Multiverse** lets Ghost-Spider jump from your game to a neighboring game. You must have permission from all players in that game before Ghost-Spider can make the jump into their game.

If no one else is playing near you or you don't have permission to move Ghost-Spider, then remove her from the game until the start of your next turn.

When Ghost-Spider enters another game or gets removed from the game set aside all her counters and Equipment. She will reappear in her original game with those counters and Equipment.

If Ghost-Spider enters another game of Vs. System 2PCG, you decide which player gains control over her. She can attack, gain counters, get stunned, get KO'd, etc., just like in her original game. However, no matter what happens she will go back to her original game at the start of your next turn. When she jumps back, any counters, Equipment, etc. that she gained in the other game will be removed.

If Ghost-Spider enters a game that isn't Vs. System 2PCG, it's up to the players in that game to decide exactly how she works in that game.

Q: Question about Ghost Spider MC's lvl 1 ability **You Can Borrow This for A While**. 

Let's say I name "Spider-Man" - who is a Spider-Friends SC. If I have an Anti-Registration (or Pro-Reg, Avengers, etc.) version of Spider-Man in my deck, does he also get Dimensional Wristwatch? Or is it ONLY the Spider-Friends version? 

The ability specifically says you have to name a Spider-Friends supporting character, but it generically says that "Characters with that name have Dimensional Wristwatch..." (It doesn't specify "Spider-Friends characters with that name...")

A: The named character must a be Spider-Friends team affiliated character, but yes every character with that name in your deck (AKAs have that name) are able to be retrieved with the wrist watch.

In this Arc, we are playing around with how players can use locations besides super powers. In addition to cards like \* Thor \* and Hyperion (who have keyword powers which requires spending an ![](%%Intellect%%) (Intellect) and ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy), each Issue will have a Plot Twist and Special Location that allow their main characters to have some pretty powerful effects on the game. A few things about these Plot Twists and Special Locations:

* They are not super powers.  
* Your main characters ust be face up to pay for them.  
* Your main characters can use a "Wild" Special Location from their team to pay for them.  
* These cards are neutral, so just like any other neutral cards, they can be in Loyalty decks.  
* The Special Locations don't count as location swith a specific power symbol (for powers like Black Widow Main Character's Level Up power **Red in Her Ledger** or ZZutak's **Paint to Life**).

*Set: Crossover Vol. 3*

If the Grandmaster is your main character, you'll need to bring and shuffle your own Battleworld pile before the game. This pile is private and contains your choice of 12 different Battleworld Domains. (Note that you will need a shuffled pile of the 10 Terrain - City cards as well.) When he uses **The Contest of Champions**, the game will enter the top Domain of your pile (just as if you were playing with the Battleworld game mode).

When any defending main character gets wounded, the game will leave that Domain (put the card into a discard pile next to the Battleworld pile). It will NOT automatically enter a new one.

If **Contest of Champions** is used again, the game will enter the next Battleworld Domain. (If the game is already in a Battleworld domain, that one goes to its discard pile.) 

If more than one player has the Grandmaster as their main character, they will each have their own Battleworld pile.

*Set: Legacy*  

Q: Does **Elder of the Universe** apply only if Grandmaster is directly involved in the combat? For example, what if my opponent has Grandmaster out and I attack one of their other characters with Carnage (Symbiote). If Grandmaster gets a -1/-1 counter and is stunned, does he get wounded? (Technically, the counter was applied during a combat - just not one that Grandmaster was involved in directly.)

A: During Combat in this case does reference a combat this character is involved in. Generally a “Combat” by itself is referring to combat this character is involved in while “Any Combat” concerns a combat this or any character is involved in.

So, in the above example, Grandmaster would take a wound because it is not during combat from his perspective (he's not directly involved in the combat).

The Sinister Six have gained two new Main Characters to choose from. Remember, when you build a Sinister Six deck, you choose any six Sinister Six characters to go with that deck.

Goblin’s **Bag of Tricks** allows you to discard Locations to make him more powerful in combat. If this causes Goblin to strike “before each other character,” this means he strikes first even if any of the characters have, for example, a power like Ferocious. And if two Goblins are in combat with that ability, they’ll strike each other at the same time. If you discard an Oscorp Location, it’s like a wild: you can treat it as though it’s any of the other four Locations that you didn’t already discard this combat.

Q:  When **Magnetokinesis** moves an equipment from a character to another, do any limitations still apply? 

A: Even though the card just says to "move" the equipment, it still counts as being equipped to the new character. Therefore, any equipping restrictions on the equipment (such Ebony Blade can only be equipped to Black Panther or Black Knight) would still apply. 

---

Q: If you move Helmet of Immunity from one character on your side to another with Grid, would you choose a second power symbol and now it blocks both symbols from being used by enemy characters?

A: It does not leave play when it is unequipped. It is equipped to the new character and that will trigger the power which will allow you to choose. HOWEVER, the second part of the power refers to "THAT type" it is singular, it can only refer to the most recent choice. It can't refer to all prior choices made.

*Set: Power & Reality*  

When you spend a power symbol from a Location in your resource row to put Hawkeye into a **Nest**, put the Location card partly underneath him and leave it face up as the **Nest**. (If you pay for the power by discarding a Location or you reduce the cost of the power to zero power symbols, nothing happens.)

While Hawkeye's **Nest** is one of the Locations named on his card, he has the associated text. 

While a Location is a **Nest**, it still counts as a Location as as being a face-up resource in your resource row, however it can't be used to generate a power symbol anymore. If the Location gets KO'd or leaves your side, the **Nest** effect ends. If the Location gets turned face down by an effect, put it back into your resource row and the **Nest** effect ends.

When Hawkeye gets stunned or leaves your side, turn the Location face down and put it into your resource row and the **Nest** effect ends.

If Hawkeye uses **I Want You On That Roof** while he already has a **Nest**, turn the old **Nest** faced own and put it into your resource row and this **Nest**effect ends.

A: While Hela is face down this power is turned off. If Hela is involved in a mutual stun, her power does NOT apply any longer. So the other character's Base Health will revert back to what it normally is before you check to see if it has enough wounds to become KO'd.

As he does not have one. Short of it, you can discard any character you like.

# Hulkling
^CardNumber: ^SEC-014

*Set: Secret Avengers*

**Half-Skrull Shapeshifter** triggers when you recruit him, but before he appears. So if you do choose to KO an enemy Supporting Character and have Hulkling appear on that enemy player's side, he won't appear on your side first.

Q: What happens if The Soul Gem is used to name Hulkling but then I try to play him?

A: Per a 2019 rules update, cards that try to appear but can't are removed from the game. So, in this scenario, you pay the recruit cost for Hulkling. In the recruit zone, you choose to KO an enemy character and give them Hulkling in return. However, since Hulkling can't appear, he will be removed from the game and play continues as normal.

# [Hybrid](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/LET-016.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^LET-016

Q: “If I have a single Hybrid in my KO pile, does that allow me to play another Hybrid via ‘**A Composite Symbiote**’? Hybrid has the names of all of those characters referenced in ‘**A Composite Symbiote**’, and his power doesn’t specifically state ‘Cards with the title…’, so, as phrased, I believe the answer to the above is Yes.”

A: The design intent for Hybrid was that you have to have four, physical cards with those names in your KO pile. Hybrid can certainly count as any of those names due to AKA, but he’s only one physical card.

Because of this unfortunate oversight, we need to tweak his wording just a little bit to support this idea:

> “During your Build Phase, if you have four supporting characters in your KO pile with the names ‘Agony’, ‘Lasher’, ‘Phage’, and ‘Riot’, you may put Hybrid from your hand onto your side.”

So if you had, for example, two Hybrids, one Lasher, and one Agony in your KO pile; you could put a Hybrid from your hand onto your side.

**Fluid Tactics** lets you convert ATK from a **Combat** Plot Twist into DEF (or vice versa). For example, if you play a Plot Twist that gives him +3 ATK, you could have him gain +3 DEF instead.

*Set: Crossover Vol. 2*  

**Duality Itself** lets you put the In-Betweener onto your side between two turns of the game. You can even do this after an enemy player's first turn but before your first turn.

The In-Betweener couldn't decide exactly how much cost, ATK, DEF, and health to have so he ended up between two whole numbers. In most cases, his stats work like this. 1 ½ cost means you must pay 1 ½ recruit points to recruit him. So you will have ½ a recruit point left over. 4 ½ ATK means his strikes will stun a 4 DEF character but not a 5 DEF character. 3 ½ DEF means if he is struck with 3 ATK, he won't get stunned, but if he gets struck with 4 ATK he will get stunned. 2 ½ (Health) means 2 wounds won't KO him, but 3 wounds will.

# [The Infinity Gauntlet](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-017.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^BLK-017

*Set: Black Order*  

While equipped, the Infinity Gauntlet allows you to turn any number of face-down Infinity Gem equipment in your resource row face up to show that you've "set" them into the Gauntlet. If a card with Infinity gets put into a KO pile from anywhere, you may shuffle it into its owner's deck. 

If the Gauntlet leaves play, leave the face-up Gems in your resource row as they are. However, you can no longer user their powers. If a character on your side equips the Gauntlet later in the game, those Gems will already be inset and its Wielder can use their power again.

**Infinite Power**  
This allows you to do anything you want for the rest of the game. Hera re some examples of things you could do:

* Put a +1/+1 counter on a character.  
* Take an extra turn.  
* Use a Build Phase power during your Main Phase.  
* Flip your deck over.  
* Institute a shared turn.  
* Win the game (unless there are any effects preventing you from winning the game).  
* Turn off any effects that are preventing you from winning the game.  
* Now win the game.  
* Draw a card.

If they pass, they're out of the **Battle of Wills**. Then the next player goes, and so on until all but one player passes. Then that player's character pays the winning number of power symbols from their resource row (no discarding from hand) and the Iso-Sphere is moved to that character (if it's not already there). 

**Note:** A character can't bid a number they can't pay. once you choose a character as a bidder, you can't choose a different character to be your bidder in the same **Battle of Wills**.

Q: Take this scenario: Jean Grey Omega MC Level 2. Owner has Dagger (HAMMER) on the board. Jean attacks, initiating her "Out of Control" power. Can Dagger convert those counters to +1 counters and still give Jean an XP?

A: Yes.

Replacement powers modify the things it says it replaces. In this case, Dagger changes the -1/-1 to +1/+1.

Straight from the compiled rules:

> Replacement Modifiers Replacement modifiers will change an existing modifier or event in order to produce a different result. This does NOT change the source of the original modifier or event, it just changes how it behaves. If two replacement modifiers are trying to change the same modifier or event, then the controller of the character being affected by the original modifier or event chooses the order. In some cases, once the first replacement modifier applies, the second one is no longer relevant. Replacement modifiers will usually begin with "If" and always contain the word, "instead."

Note the second sentence.

This does NOT change the source of the original modifier or event, it just changes how it behaves.

If Jenn is in your deck, you start the game with a **Wish** pile. When you make your deck, choose three different cards and put two copies of each of them into your **Wish** pile. There are a few rules (besides no wishing for more wishes):

- You can't choose Tokens.
- You can't choose Main Characters or Locations.
- You can't choose cards that start the game in piles (like Agendas) or cards that require a pile of their own.
- You **can** choose cards that couldn't start in your deck, like Illustrated Universe cards and other teams' Loyalty cards.
- You **can** choose copies of cards that are already in your deck, even if your deck already has the maximum number of those cards. 

During setup put your **Wish** pile out of play face down. Your Wish pile is private. (Your opponents can't look at it but you can look at it any time.)

When you make a Wish, remove both copies of any card in your Wish pile from the game, and choose an enemy player. **While those cards are removed this way, you may play one and that player may play one.**

If the cards are Equipment or Plot Twists both of you may ignore any team affiliation play restrictions on them. If a card would be put into a KO pile, it goes into its owner's (your) KO pile.

Juggernaut is so big and powerful it’s almost impossible to beat him physically. Fortunately (for his enemies) he’s vulnerable to other kinds of attacks. This is represented on his card by his **It’s Gonna Take Something More to Stop Me!** power, which allows enemy players to spend an ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy) to weaken him.

^CardNumber: ^MNB-096

*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*

Q: How does his **Unstoppable** power work?

A: You make a solo attack with him against a front row character, then during combat you activate his power. If he stuns the defender and survives the combat, you may then immediately make another solo attack with him against a back row character controlled by the same player. Leave Juggernaut exhausted and dive right into his second combat. You can attack a back row character this way even if there are still face up front row characters.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

---

Q: If I use Enchantress' **Go Forth My Champion** on Juggernaut, and then activate **Unstoppable** on his first attack on a front row character, does he exhaust for his second **Unstoppable** attack?

A: In the case of Juggernaut it says to immediately attack a back row character, so the game jumps right back into combat. When "blah" is attacked/attacks triggers will still happen, but the normal rules for checking the legality if the attack (exhausting the attacker, making sure they are not protected etc.) do not apply. So in the case of Juggernaut + Enchantress it would work like this:  
  
* Use Enchantress's power on Juggernaut.  
* Juggernaut attacks a front row character and immediately readies.  
* Juggernaut uses his Unstoppable super power.  
* Juggernaut stuns the front row character and survives.  
* Juggernaut immediately attacks a back row character without exhausting.  
* Assuming Juggernaut survives the second combat he will still be ready.

Q: I attack with my Unstoppable Juggernaut. My opponent's front row character Plays Dead. Do I still get to trample through or no?

A: If you use Play Dead on a defender, the combat is over. Since Juggernaut did not stun the defender, his ability will not trigger.

*Set: The Frightful*

If any number of Kangs are in your deck, **The Tomorrow War** lets you pick a single **Future Date** before players draw their opening hands during setup. A **Future Date** is represented by a whole number from 1-10. It counts as being that "Date" while you have exactly that many resources.

So if you pick 7 as your **Future Date**, Kang can only appear while you have exactly seven resources. (On the bright side, he's free.) Note: If you forget to pick a **Future Date** at the beginning of the game, the game acts as though you chose 10 as the Date. 

**Time Will Tell** sets Kang's base ATK/DEF to be equal to the **Future Date** you selected. It doesn't matter how many resources you currently have. **Time Will Tell** "locks in" when you select the **Future Date** before the game starts.

Q: What if I use Singularity  to remove Kate Pryde from the battlefield. Does she still get XP from **Past**?

A: If multiple triggers occur at the same time, the turn player decides the order in which they resolve.
Powers only affect characters in play, and Level up powers are not an exception.

So, with Singularity, if you activated her power: both **Pocket Dimension** and **Past** activate at end of turn, and the active player decides in which order to resolve them.

If you resolve **Pocket Dimension** first, then Kate cannot gain the XP from **Past**, because she is not in play when it resolves.

Q: What if I use **Invisibility** to **Hide** Kate Pryde. Does she still get XP from **Past**?

A: In order for **Past** (her level up power) to trigger, Kate Pryde must be face-up and in play.

However the keyword **Invisibility** states:
> At the end of your turn, if this character is ready, you may hide it.

It is an End of Turn trigger like **Past**, so **Past** and **Invisibility** would both trigger at the same time. Even if **Invisibility** resolves first and hides Kate Pryde, the level up power **Past** has already triggered and will continue to resolve.

# [Killmonger](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MCU4-015.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MCU4-015

*Set: MCU Power and Reality*  

Q:

I've literally pored over Facebook for over an hour to try and address this, but only found a piece of it. Can we get a definitive ruling on how MCU Killmonger Supporting Character works in various scenarios? Here is the only definitive ruling I've found from a (UDE/SAG source (Chad Daniel))[https://www.facebook.com/groups/860168987351982/posts/2486465308055667/?comment_id=2486884324680432]

> As it is written, it is one power, not two seperate powers. You will only get the printed powers of the MC you choose when KMs power triggers. And it is locked in at that time. So if the MC is face down when you play KM, you get nothing. If the MC is face up when KM is played, but is kater Face down or RFGed, KM still has the powers.

So, some follow up questions that this doesn't address:

- Per the above, Killmonger (KM) only gets powers that are active at the time he appears. However, if the MC is face-down when KM appears, does that MC regain its powers when it turns face up?

  - Or, if the MC is face-up when KM appears but is turned face-down afterward. When it recovers, does it re-gain powers at that point? (KM's power says the MC loses powers, but it doesn't say that it can't gain them.)

- The rulebook notes that powers are lost when turning face-down, but doesn't specifically indicate whether they count as being "gained" when recovered.

- What about powers that remain active for face-down characters (such as Swarm and Symbiosis). Does KM turn those off and gain them from face-down MCs?

- What happens when KM appears when an MC is face-up and L1 but subsequently levels up? Does the MC re-gain all powers on its L2 card? Only new powers that it didn't lose as L1?

A: 
We believe most of this has been asked and answered on our official rules channel of the discord. Below is the entry.

> “What happens when Killmonger is recruited, but the opponent's Main is face-down at that moment? You will only gain the printed powers of the Main Character you choose at the time I Want the Throne triggers. If the Main Character is face down when you play Killmonger, you will gain nothing because that characters powers are lost while stunned. If the Main Character is face up when Killmonger is played and then becomes face-down or removed from game, Killmonger retains those powers since he gained them at the time of his appearance.”

- To point 1, since the MC didn’t lose any powers when Killmonger appeared, it will have its powers once it turns face up.

- To point 2, a character that has lost powers does not regain them by turning face down and then face up again. Turning face down “turns off” any powers the character has. And then turning face up again “turns back on” those powers. But in the example the main character has lost those powers so they are not there to “turn back on.”

- Point 3 mentions two different cases:
	- If a MC has a power that “remains on while a character is stunned”, then it will be “active” when Killmonger appears, so Killmonger will gain it and cause that character to lose it. (“Remains on while the character is stunned” doesn’t prevent other effects from causing the character to lose the power.)

	- If a MC has a power that “can’t be turned off”, then that power can’t be lost due to Killmonger’s effect. HOWEVER, Killmonger will still gain the power. In other words, Killmonger’s effect does not require the MC to lose a power in order for Killmonger to gain it. (It would have needed to say something like “Killmonger gains each power lost this way.)
	
	For example, if the MC has Swarm, Killmonger will gain Swarm even though the MC will not lose Swarm.

- To point 4, a leveled up character is not a new character so it will not regain any powers it has lost, but any new powers it has will work normally.

# The Kingpin
## [The Kingpin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-029.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: ^DEF-028, ^DEF-029, ^LEG-046, ^LEG-047

*Set: Defenders*

Q: When I discard a Location card to use a Super Power does that give Kingpin an XP?

A: No, "appears" means to come into play from anywhere, so the Location has to be put into play. So playing one from your hand into your resource row or putting one into play from the top of your deck with Nick Fury would count. Discarding does not.

## [The Kingpin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-047.jpg) (SC)
^CardNumber: ^DEF-047

*Set: The Defenders*  

**Underworld Boss**  
The Kingpin Supporting Character has a Super Power where he takes over as your main character. When this happens, your former Main Character becomes a Supporting Character and remains in the game. It can still gain XP and Level Up, but you don’t lose the game if it gets KO’d. Instead, you now lose the game when Kingpin gets KO’d.

Q: If Kingpin (SC) becomes my Main Character will Groot (my former MC) still be able to level down? And if so will he sill get XP later on?

A: Groot retains his powers and Level Up ability, and **We Are Groot** is a Super Power that puts him back to Level 1, so yes.

Q: I control lvl2 Professor X and 2 Underworld supporting characters. I (until end of turn) gain control of your Kingpin SC. I activate Kingpin's super power and he becomes my main character. I end my turn and return control of your Kingpin SC (my MC). You could hypothetically KO my entire board and be unable to KO my main character. What rules are there dealing with this?

A: You lose the game. More specifically, at the beginning of your next turn if your opponent controls your MC, you lose the game.

Q: Can I steal an opponent's Kingpin with Purple Man after they've used **Underworld Boss** to make him their MC?

A: If Kingpin uses **Underworld Boss** and becomes the MC, he is no longer an SC and effects that require an SC can not be used or played on Kingpin. In short Purple Man can NOT steal Kingpin once he becomes a MC.

Q: If I activate **Underworld Boss** while Elektra is in my hand, what happens to Elektra?

A: She is demoted to a Supporting character no matter what zone she is in. From the rules: "Some effects may promote a Supporting Character to Main Character and vice versa. Unlike most modifiers, these modifiers can apply to a Main Character in any zone (or side) and continue to apply to the character even if it changes zones."

^CardNumber: ^SYN-002

*Set: Sinister Syndicate*  

**Spring the Trap**  
Kraven has a Reaction super power. These types of super powers work a little differently than normal super powers. Reaction powers trigger when a certain condition is met (in Kraven’s case, it’s “when an enemy supporting character appears”). When that happens you can pay a ![](%%Skill%%) (Skill), and if you do, you put three -1/-1 counters on that character. You can use a Reaction super power at any time, as long as its trigger condition is met. However, like other super powers, you can only use it once per turn.

Q: If I have a Doombot on my side, can I use Kristoff to power up Doctor Doom?

A: No. Kristoff's power is not active when he his in your hand. Therefore he doesn't have "AKA Doctor Doom" until his is in the Play zone.

Q: When does Death Strike determine if Lady Deathstrike has survived the Combat if I bring her into combat with an MC with Dramatic Entrance? If she isn't stunned by the Attacking MC and activated Death Strike will the MC get 2 wounds even though Dramatic Entrance will KO her at the end of combat?

A: To survive combat means to be unstunned at the conclusion of combat resolution; The survival check/combat resolution is distinctly before end of combat effects triggering. So yes, the MC will get 2 wounds.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

---

Q: How does Lady's Deathstrike's Death Strike ability interact with Luke Cage's Impervious skin? would he negate both wounds?

A: Impervious Skin would not apply because it only prevents wounds from getting stunned, it does NOT prevent wounds given another way. The wound given by Lady Deathstrike's Super Power is NOT from stunning, it is given directly by the resolving effect.

Legacy can pay for **Nega-Bands** by spending either a ![](%%Might%%) (Might) or Negative Zone Location. Spending a Negative Zone means turning a Location named Negative Zone face down in your resource row or discarding one from your hand.

Q: Scenario: I play Legion and a Personality takes over. My opponent then Nullifies  **Spontaneous Mutation**. What happens to Legion? Does he remain "stuck" as the personality that took over until his power returns? Or does he revert to his base card? (I think he's stuck as the personality, but not 100% sure).

A:  He remains "stuck" with his current personality.

Nullifying Spontaneous Mutation takes away him changing from one Personality to another, but it doesn't get rid of the current Personality he has.

Q: If Lilith KO's Mantis or Dormammu Are they removed from game, or do their own powers happen instead? (Mantis to the row, Dormammu shuffled into the deck.)

A: When multiple triggers happen at the same time, the active player chooses which happens first. If it's the Lilith player's turn they may choose to remove the KO'd character from the game first (and gain a Health). As soon as these characters change zones, any other modifiers are lost. If it's the Mantis or Immortal player's turn, they can choose their triggers to happen first and the Lilith modifier is lost and they are not removed from the game (also Lilith does not gain a Health).

*Set: Futures Past*

Here's how his **Canadian Resistance Colonel** works:

 - You can recruit characters from the three mutant teams face down (without revealing them), and if you do, they appear hidden (face down and ready) on your side, instead of face up.
 - While you still must pay normally for cards recruited this way (including any additional costs), you do not have to announce the recruit cost of the hidden cards you are recruiting.
 - For example, if you have 7 recruit points and you recruit a 3-cost and 4-cost character face down, you don't have to announce how much you paid for each one or how much you paid total. (However, you can't spend more recruit points than you have.)
    * You must also follow any other rules about recruiting, including any restrictions for when a character can appear, including uniqueness rules.
 - Hidden cards recruited this way mostly act like other hidden cards:
    * They aren't stunned, can't have Equipment or +1/+1 or -1/-1 counters, can't be attacked, and lose their powers.
    * They keep their names and team affiliations.
    * During your Recovery Phase, you must turn hidden cards on your side face up when you recover your stunned characters.
 - There are exceptions to cards recruited this way when compared to normal hidden cards.
	 * Only the cards' owner can look at them.
	 * They can make attacks while hidden on the turn appear:
		 * Cards with printed ![](%%Flight%%) and ![](%%Range%%) can make attacks while hidden as if they still had those powers.
		 * Remember, these cards keep their team affiliations, so they can make team attacks as normal, even with face-up characters.
		 * They don't exhaust when they attack.
		 * Right before they strike, turn them face up and exhaust them.

**Note:** Opponents will need to verify after cards recruited this way are turned face up that they were played within the rules, especially in regard to their costs.
