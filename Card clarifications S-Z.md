^CardNumber: ^BOM-006, ^BOM-007

*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*

Q: On Sabretooth's level up it says at the end of "each turn". Because it doesn't say "your turn" does this mean he gains XP at the end of my opponent's turn as well. Or does it mean after both I and my opponent have had a turn?

A: Yes he gains an XP for every turn he is face up; both yours and your opponent's.

# Scarlet Spider
## [Scarlet Spider](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SPF-003.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: ^SPF-003, ^SPF-004

*Set: Spider-Friends*  

Before he was the Scarlet Spider, the man who would become Ben Reilly was created from Peter Parker’s DNA to be a perfect clone. So in the game he actually starts off as a different “Spider” hero until his true self is revealed (once he reaches Level 2). Here’s how it works: 

Your Spider Web is a new out-of-play pile that includes up to one copy of every other Level 1 main character with “Spider” in its name. (Currently this includes Spider-Man from The Marvel Battles expansion, \* Spider-Man \* from Monsters Unleashed, and Spider-Man and Spider-Woman from this Issue.) 

Your Clone Pile is another out-of-play pile. It starts empty but during the game you’ll put characters from your Spider Web into it. 

Before the game begins, when each player reveals their main character, you’ll reveal the Scarlet Spider. Then instead of putting him on your side during setup, you’ll put a character from your Spider Web onto your side. 

When that character would become Level 2, you’ll instead transform it into Level 2 Scarlet Spider. (It will keep its counters, any effects on it, and its ready/exhausted and face-up/facedown orientation.) Then put the Level 1 main character he started the game as and the Level 1 Scarlet Spider main character into your Clone Pile. 

Once he’s Level 2, if he would be wounded, there’s a chance it was just a clone body instead: reveal a random card from your Clone Pile. If you reveal Scarlet Spider, he’ll get wounded as normal – they found you! But if you reveal someone else, he doesn’t get wounded (although whoever was revealed goes back into your Spider Web.)

You start the game with both Main Characters (Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver) and are only out of the game once both are KO'd. 

**I Looked in Your Head and Saw Annihilation** prevents enemy characters from using a Super Power more than one more time for the rest of the game. This includes Main Characters that have Super Powers. Once Scarlet Witch uses that power, it will last the whole game, even after she is KO'd.

Q: What happens to the MC when Singularity takes them out the game while being **Hex**ed by Scarlet Witch?

# Scorn
^CardNumber: ^CAR-014

*Set: Maximum Carnage*  

Q: With Scorn, when she is flipped face down (by being stunned) does her equipment remain face-up? 

For example, if she has Iso-Sphere and she is stunned, does she still get the benefit from the Iso-Sphere when attacked by Devil Slayer? OR, similarly, is the "Battle of Wills" still in effect if she gets stunned?

A: Yes the equipment will remain face up as long as she is equipped with it. Only the character gets turned face down.

A stunned character doesn't have its own powers but it can still be affected by modifiers coming from other places including equipment it has. For example, if there were a character in play granting all other characters +1/+1, a stunned character. Usually, modifiers affecting a stunned character doesn't mean much since stunned characters don't usually do anything. But in the cases mentioned above it would matter. 

Iso-Sphere would keep granting the equipped character those stats (which would be relevant if it were attacked by Devil Slayer). Iso-Sphere will still trigger a Battle of Wits even while Scorn is stunned. 

One other thing -- a stunned character cannot use a super power on an equipment it has.

A: Yes. See [Omega Red](#wiki_omega_red) for a similar power and the rule insert clarification for him.

# [Secret Hideout](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SFO-016.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^SFO-016

*Set: Spidey-Foes*  

**Family is a Source of Weakness** lets your (Sinister Syndicate) Main Character take a **Hostage**. If you have any Secret Hideouts in your deck, you must bring a Hostage pile, which includes one ore more *different* (Spider-Friends) Supporting Characters with the **Friends and Family** keyword.

When you play Secret Hideout, one of your Main Characters takes a **Hostage**. Choose a character from your Hostage pile and put it beneath the Secret Hideout as a **Hostage**. Your Main Character gets the Keyword Power granted by that Hostage *while that Main Character is in your front row*.

For example, if you take Mary Jane hostage, your Main Character will gain **Pounce** while it's in  your front row. (It doesn't have to be protecting anyone.)

When that Main character gets stunned or leaves play, turn the Secret Hideout face down and set the **Hostage** aside. (It doesn't go back to your Hostage pile.) Similarly, if an effect turns the Secret Hideout face down, set the **Hostage** aside. Once the **Hostage** card is no longer beneath the Secret Hideout it also stops granting its Keyword Power.

It's possible for the same Main Character to have multiple Hostages (one for each Secret Hideout you play while you have that Main Character). 

Note: A **Hostage** is never actually in play. It's either in a Hostage pile, beneath a Secret Hideout, or set aside (after leaving a Secret Hideout).

^CardNumber: ^BOM-017

*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*  

**Anchor Host**  
Shadow King is technically a supporting character but he doesn’t want to actually be in play. He prefers to have a physical host. If he would appear for any reason, you’ll remove him from the game instead and choose a face-up character on your side to be his Host. If you don’t have a face-up character, Shadow King will still be removed from the game. When his Host gets stunned or leaves play Shadow King will remain removed from the game.

^(Source: Rule insert)

Q: Can I use Boomerang (for example) to remove keyword powers from Shadow King's host, and thereby remove the effects from the **Anchor Host** power?

A: No. **Anchor Host** isn't granted to the host as a keyword power, per se. It is a keyword power on Shadow King (who has now been removed from game). The effect granted to the host is considered a modifier, so it isn't removed by effects that remove powers.

*Set: A-Force*  

**Rules Lawyer**  
She-Hulk’s main character introduces a new kind of super power called a **Reaction**. It reads: 

> Reaction : When an enemy player uses a super power, you may say “Objection!” If you do, cancel that super power.

Reaction powers trigger when a certain condition is met (in this case it’s “When an enemy player uses a super power”). When that happens you can pay an (and say “Objection” of course) and if you do it cancels the super power so it never takes effect.

You can use a Reaction power at any time, as long as its trigger condition is met. However, like other super powers, you can only use it once per turn.

^(Source: Rule insert)

Q: How does **Rules Lawyer** work timing wise under the rules for effects needing to resolve as soon as they are played?

A: Basically when She-Hulk LV2 is in play, whenever an opponent uses a Super Power, they will need to give the She-Hulk player a chance to respond before resolving the effect.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

---

Q: How does **Rules Lawyer** work if the Super Power needs one choice made from multiple options?

A: If the effect requires a choice, like choosing a character, the She-Hulk player has to make their decision on whether or not to use **Rules Lawyer** before those choices are made.

Q: What happens if I use Singularity's power to remove my characters, then on my opponent's turn, Singularity is targeted by Cosmo. Do my characters still return at the end of the turn or when singularity is stunned/leaves play?

A: Singularity's power creates a delayed triggered modifier that exists independent of its source. Removing the power from the source does nothing to negate or change the delayed trigger modifier already created. In short, playing Cosmo on Singularity does not stop the previously removed characters from returning.

Q: Juggernaut attacks Singularity who is in the front row, pays a ![](%%Might%%) (Might) and stuns her. Do the other characters come back in time for Juggernaut to declare his second attack or no?

A:  The controller of Singularity decides which row the characters come back into play. So they could put them in the front row, or the back row. So if they opt to put them all in the front row, it is no dice. If they put at least one in the back row, the next question then becomes, can Juggernaut attack them? And the answer is YES! You see, Singularity triggers upon her leaving play which is during combat resolution, so that is when her power triggers. Juggernaut on the other hand, triggers after combat resolution is over. Since Singularity triggered first, it will resolve first and your opponent could opt to put a character into his back row. IF he does, then it will be there for Juggernaut to attack when his trigger resolves.

Can Sister Grimm use a **...Let the Staff of One Emerge** ability she has previously used since technically she's a new character and now has not technically used the previous ability?

A: A once per game restriction is something that functions in all zones, no matter who controls the character or what zone it is in. This means even if a character with a power with a once per game restriction leaves play and comes back, you still can not use it again if it was used before leaving play. Also if an opponent takes control of a character with a one per game restriction, if they use the super power, when you get it back, you will not be able to use that power.

**Energy Rings** puts -1/-1 counters on an enemy Sonya "could attack." To use this power Sonya must be able to attack (for example, she can't be exhausted) and the character that gets the -1/-1 counters can't be protected (unless Sonya currently has a way to attack a protected character).

Even though its name is spelled differently it still counts as being "Spider" for the purpose of powers that reference the word "Spider", such as \* Spider-Man \*' s **Spider-People**. It's just how they spell in the future!

SP//dr must not have any wounds at the start of your turn in order for its **Genius** power to trigger. So even if **Regeneration** heals SP//dr's last wound, you won't get to draw from **Genius** that turn.

His **Amazing** and **Spectacular** Super Powers allow him to strike before the time when characters strike at the end of combat. Apply his current ATK to the enemy character's current DEF. If the ATK is equal to or greater than the DEF, stun the enemy character. The enemy character does not strike Spider-Man when he uses these powers. Spider-Man still gets to strike at the end of the combat as normal.

*Set: Spider-Friends*  

**I Can and Will Fight You**
This issue introduces the powerful Alien Symbiote version of Spider-Man. But as they say, with great alien power comes great alien… danger. While the symbiote does make him stronger, he must remove it or it will quickly be game over. In the comics, when Spider-Man fights off the symbiote, it splits off from him as a separate entity. In the game, when Spider-Man sheds the symbiote, it splits off from him as a separate card. When this happens, Spider-Man will become Level 2 and now wears a cloth version of his black costume and the Alien Symbiote will look for a new host. (Note: Spider-Man Level 2 has one less Health – this represents losing the strength of the symbiote.) 

When a character with the Alien Symbiote is turned face down but isn’t KO’d, just keep the equipment token face up and ready, just like when it’s equipped to a face-up character (it doesn’t exhaust or turn face down). And remember, the symbiote is a jealous entity – it can’t be destroyed or removed from its host (at least until the host leaves play).

When **Tony's Tinkering** lets Spider-Man download an **Update**, put an **Update** counter on him. (You can use a coin, bead, slip of paper, or an XP counter to keep track of Spidey's **Updates**). When Spidey installs **Updates**, you may remove any number of **Update** counters from him.

If you remove exactly one **Update** he gains ![](%%Flight%%) and ![](%%Range%%) until he leaves play. If you remove exactly two **Updates**, put two vitality counters on him. If you remove exactly three **Updates**, put twelve +1/+1 counters on him.

You can remove the same number of **Updates** more than once. For example, if you remove the two **Updates** for a second time, Spider-Man will get two more vitality counters.

Note: **Update** counters aren't removed from Spidey when he gets turned face down. However, they are still removed when he leaves play.

This Spider-Man, from the Ultimate Universe, is our first character to share a mantle with two other people! (Miles Morales and the main Marvel Universe's Peter Parker.) In this comics, this Peter died... but then came back to life because the **Oz Formula** that gave him his powers also granted him immortality. For the game, this means when Peter is KO'd, you won't lose the game immediately for not having a main character. You'll have until the end of your next turn to bring him back when a Supporting Character with the **Friends and Family** keyword appears on your side. In this case, put him back onto your side with wounds equal to his (Health) minus 1. (With the **Oz Formula** mechanic, Peter can continue fighting for those he cares about.)

^CardNumber: ^GAL-006

*Set: Galactic Guardians*  

Kitty Pryde becomes Star-Lord when the original Star-Lord is otherwise employed. So she has *s around her name, meaning she shares the "mantle" with Star-Lord, himself. The sharing of the mantle means both characters can be on a side at the same time because they're different beings, just with the same name. So you don't KO either because of the uniqueness rules and they can't power each other up.

Note that although this card represents her joining the Guardians of the Galaxy she's still an X-Men at heart, so she has both team affiliations.

Her **Intangibility** power lets her strike characters while they're in a player's hand. This is uncanny. A couple things about this: 

* She can strike any number of 0 DEF characters (or characters with * DEF).  
* She can strike characters who normally couldn't be struck by her while on a side (like Bulletproof characters) because those powers aren't active while the character is in a hand.

>Supreme Leader's effect will prevent you from losing the game and will also prevent other players from winning the game

Supreme Leader MC is worded in a way that may make veterans of other card games such as Magic the Gathering believe that a card like [Dutch SC](https://i.imgur.com/N3EzGfJ.jpg) or [Deadpool MC](https://i.imgur.com/3Qt4DfF.png) may still allow an alternate win condition.  After all, in MtG a player being unable to lose doesn't prevent another player from winning as they are isolated effects.  In VS 2PCG this is considered an extension of the "can't beats can" rule.  By that logic, alternate win conditions are ignored as long as Supreme Leader is preventing its controller from losing the game.

Q: What happens if I recruit Taskmaster while my opponent has Onslaught in play?

A: So Onslaught's Power happens at the time you recruit him (faster than appears powers).  
  
Taskmaster comes into play, but doesn't have Onslaught's power when he's recruited, so nothing happens.  
  
As far as the power's that Onslaught has, Taskmaster doesn't copy those because they aren't Printed Powers like Taskmaster is looking for.  
  
So Onslaught is effectively doing nothing for Taskmaster.

> Keyword abilities are only in effect while the character card is in play unless otherwise specified.

Previous to [Taskmaster's](https://i.imgur.com/85KjJHT.jpg) release, keyword abilities were active in all zones.  This allowed cards such as [Hope Summers](https://i.imgur.com/R2iOAee.png) to use their powers from the hand, deck or KO pile.  With the release of Taskmaster, this rule became limiting on design of future cards and was changed.  (For example, Taskmaster was able to be recruited from the deck with [Spider-Gwen's](https://i.imgur.com/ZkdbqZ0.png) Dimensional Watch keyword if your opponent had her in play.)

^(Source: Official clarification)

>A copied power can't copy a power with the same name as itself.

An infinite loop was discovered when [Taskmaster](https://i.imgur.com/85KjJHT.jpg) was across from an opposing Taskmaster where they would gain a copy of, then continuously copy the printed version of their opponent's Photgraphic Reflexes.  With this additional rule, this scenario would result in Taskmaster gaining two instances of all keyword powers for face-up enemy supporting characters, but the loop would not continue beyond two instances.

Q: Scenario: I have Taskmaster on my side and my opponent plays H.A.M.M.E.R. Cloak. Is Cloak hit with -1/-1 counters from Taskmaster copying **Darkforce Channeling**?

A: Yes. Powers are active before the character appears (see official rules). Taskmaster is therefore able to copy this power and when Cloak appears he gets hit with Taskmaster's copy of **Darkforce Channeling**.

At Level 3, when it's time to **Bring Balance to the Universe**, you must reveal the six Marvel Locations (they have the Marvel logo at the bottom) and snap. Then count all of the characters on all sides and KO half of them. (If there's an odd number, KO one more than half.)

You choose which characters to KO. If you want to win the game, we recommend KOing each enemy Main Character, but it's up to you.

Q: If Thanos is stunned as an enemy character is KO'd as the result of striking each other, will Thanos get an XP for **The Mad Titan**?

A: Yes.

Q: When a token takes lethal damage, does it become KO'd and count towards Thanos' level up ability?

A: Thanos will gain XP from a Token being KO'd and Tokens will exist for a brief moment in the KO pile before ceasing to exist via the rules of the game. Basically if a token ever ends up in a non play zone, it will cease to exist.

Q: If I use Professor X to take my opponent's level 2 Thanos, and I use **Infinity Gauntlet**, does Thanos get stunned?

A: No, "Your" refers to the MC you control. At the time **Infinity Gauntlet** resolves, the opponent does not control an MC, so nothing happens with that part of the effect.

^CardNumber: ^BLK-005, ^BLK-006, ^BLK-007

*Set: Black Order*  

At Level 1, if Thanos gets KO'd by getting stunned, **Resurrected by Death Herself** will cause him to gain an XP and become Level 2 while in the stunned position. (If a power like Hex prevents him from leveling up, he'll remain at Level 1 but still heal his wounds.)

**Schemes and Dreams**  prevents you from drawing cards during your Draw Phase, including your normal draws plus effects like Genius. However, if Thanos is face down at the start of your turn, Schemes and Dreams will be turned off. This means you can draw cards during your Draw Phase, however you can't search for a card.

**My Quest Begins** counts each card that enters your hand from your deck. So if you draw three cards, that would be 3 XP.
  
**The Universe Will Now Be Set Right**  has a 50-50 chance of removing each character on each side from the game. If this removes a players last main character, that player ;oses the game. If this removes each player's last main character (including Thanos, himself) then the Thanos player wins the game. (This is similar to how if the final two main characters KO each other in combat, the player whose turn it was wins.)

# Thicket
^CardNumber: ^CV4-036

*Set: Crossover Vol. 4*

Q: The Terrain card "Thicket" says that "You can't have more than one character in this row." 

So, If I place the card in a row that already has, say, 3 characters what happens?
* Does my opponent have to move 2 of the 3 immediately?
* Does my opponent have to move 2 of the 3 during the next formation step?
* Does something else happen to 2 of the 3 characters?

A: The general answer is -- If a character is ever in a row it’s not allowed to be in, the player on that side must move it to a different one of their rows immediately. If an effect is preventing that move, then the character gets KO’d.

So in the example, your opponent moves two of the three immediately. And if some effect is preventing those characters from moving

(Perhaps another player has put a Thicket in that opponent’s other row and there’s already a character there), then your opponent must choose two of those characters to be KO’d.

Thor’s **Journey of Self Discovery** Level Up power requires him to make three separate attacks in the order printed on his card to gain an XP. These attacks don’t have to be in a row. For example, he could make a solo attack, then a team attack with one teammate, then another solo attack, and finally when he team attacks with exactly two other characters he’ll gain an XP.

^CardNumber: ^COS-011

*Set: Cosmic Avengers*  

Jane Foster becomes Thor when the original Thor shirks his responsibility. She has \*s around her name, meaning she shares the "mantle" with Thor himself. This means both characters can be on a side at the same time because they're different beings, just with the same name. So you don't KO either because of uniqueness rules and they can't power each other up. When Thor is ready to start being "the" Thor again, Jane gracefully demurs. 

To represent this, her **There Must Always Be a Thor** power can only search for a card named "Thor" (with no \*s ) or with **AKA Thor** (like Odinson). It can't get a copy of herself. 

Jane's **A God Who Knows How Precious Life Is** is not a super power.

# Time Variance Authority
^CardNumber: ^LKI-025

*Set: Loki*

**TVA Headquarters** allows all players to play an extra resource on each of their turns as long as that extra resource is a Location with a name that isn't already on any side. For example, on the first turn of the game you could play Time Variance Authority as your regular resoruce, and then play a Fortress as your additional resource. 

On the next player's turn they could play ANY resource (including a face down card, a Fortress, or a Time Variance Authority) as their regular resource. And then they could play an extra resource as long as it's a Location that doesn't have the same name as a Location on any side.

Let's say they play an Academy as their regular resource. They can now play another Location other than Academy, Fortress, or Time Variance Authority as their extra resource. 

Now it's back to your turn. You play a Time Variance Authority as your regular resource so now there are two **TVA Headquarters** happening, which menas you can play up to two extra Locations. You play a Training Ground as your first extra Location. But the only other Locations you have in your hand are a Fortress and another Training Ground so you can't play either.

During the game you can use any Ultron’s **There’s Only One Path To Peace** power to put the lowest level Ultron from your Ultron Facility onto your side. When one of your Ultron main 27 characters gets KO’d it goes back to your Ultron Facility where it will be available to be brought back again.

Q: If Valkyrie MCU MC KO's an opposing SC in combat, but is stunned herself in the process, does she get XP? (Does she go face-down before the opposing character goes to the KO pile or is it simultaneous?)

A: She does not get XP in this scenario. From the compiled rulebook:

> When a character becomes stunned, remove counters from it except wound and vitality counters, KO any equipment on it, turn it face down exhausted, and put a wound counter on it. If it now has wounds greater than or equal to its Health, or has a Lethal wound, it’s KO’d. Put it into its owner’s KO pile.

So, Valkyrie would be turned face-down and lose her level-up power before the character was put in the KO pile.

Q: If Wolverine team attacks with one other character, but in the middle of combat the other character gets stunned by a Plot Twist or Super Power, and then Wolverine stuns the defender, will Wolverine get an XP because now it ended up being a solo attack?

A: Yes, because it only checks if it was a solo attack during combat resolution.

Q: If Wolverine is stunned as an enemy character is stunned as the result of striking each other, will Wolverine get an XP?

A: Yes.

Q: Scenario: Wolverine level 2 has 4 wounds and 1 XP. He attacks and trades with a defender. Question: Does wolverine take his 5th wound and get KO'd or can he get the XP and level up first (gaining a 6th health).

A: There is a difference between a stunned Wolverine leveling up while stunned and a stunned Wolverine leveling up before he is KO'ed. While technically the level-up power will trigger, by the time it resolves, Wolverine is already KO'ed.

**Guardian of These Books** will trigger when you use an ![](%%Intellect%%) (Intellect) Super Power, even if you don't actually spend an ![](%%Intellect%%) (Intellect). For example, Bruce Banner's **I Think I'm Getting The Hang of It!** is an ![](%%Intellect%%) (Intellect) and ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy) Super Power and will trigger **Guardian of These Books** even if Bruce spends an ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy) to use it (and even if he spends nothing because Iron Man is on your side!).

See [The Wrecking Crew](#wiki_the_wrecking_crew)

# The Wrecking Crew
*Set: Masters of Evil*

Three **Wrecking Crew** members can each attack a different part of the game, and the Wrecker can attack any one of the three each time he attacks. (They can also make normal attacks.) Here's how it works:

These are all melee attacks so in order to make them, the **Wrecking Crew** member must be ready and in his front row, and he will exhaust to start the combat.

The **Wrecking Crew** character can attack an enemy player’s resource row/hand/deck even if that player has any face-up characters on their sides. In other words, characters can’t “protect” a resource row, hand, or deck from the **Wrecking Crew**.

While a member of the Wrecking Crew is attacking a hand, deck, or resource row, he counts as being an attacker, but there is no defending character. (The opponent still counts as the “defending player” though.) Players can play Plot Twists, use Super Powers, or Power Up as normal. For example, the defending player could play a Plot Twist to reduce the attacker’s ATK or cancel the combat.

These special attacks can be team attacks as long as each character in the attack is allowed to attack that special part of the game. For example, Piledriver and the Wrecker could team attack an enemy hand. In this case, their effects will resolve in the order the attacking player chooses. So you could have the Piledriver make the opponent discard and then draw cards, and then after that the Wrecker would do the same (or vice versa).

Q: Can I use Dramatic Entrance to redirect an opposing Wrecking Crew character's attack to one of my other characters?

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

**Self-Awareness**
(**Editor's note:** The original text from the rule insert has been omitted to prevent confusion. The text below is a clarified version of the power that was posted to the official compiled rulebook.)  

Characters that know they are in a Card Game play too! While a character knows they are in a card game, they have the following powers:

- When character appears, he gets his own hand and resource row until he leaves your side.
- When character moves to your side, he gets his own hand and resource row until he leaves your side.

Note: The hand counts as being part of your hand, and the resource row counts as being part of your resource row.

Here’s how it works:

- At the end of your Draw Phase, The character draws two cards into his part of your hand. (Keep these cards separate from the main part of your hand.)

    - This is the only way to add cards to his part of your hand. If another effect would add cards to your hand, they always go to the main part of your hand, never to the character’s part of your hand.
    - All other effects that affect your hand work as normal.
    - Example: If you are forced to ”discard a random card”, you must randomize all the cards in your
hand, including Wyatt’s part of your hand.
- At the end of your Resource Step, the character may play a resource from his hand into his part of your resource row. (Keep these resources separate from the main part of your resource row.)

    - This is the only way to add resources to his part of your resource row. If another effect would add resources to your resource row, they always go to the main part of your resource row, never to the character’s part of your resource row.
  
- At the end of your Recruit Step (after you’ve spent your normal Recruit Points to play cards from the main part of your hand, and any leftover Recruit Points go away), you gain 1 Recruit Point for each resource in the character’s part of the resource row. You can only spend these Recruit Points to play cards from the character’s part of your hand.
- Characters and Equipment you play from the character’s part of the hand work as normal once they are on your side. (Once they’re in play, it doesn’t matter if they came from your main hand or the character’s part of your hand.)
- You can play Plot Twists or Power Ups from the character’s part of your hand as normal.
- You can spend Locations in the character’s part of your resource row or discard them from the character’s hand to generate power symbols normally.
- When the character leaves your side , remove the cards in his part of your hand and resource row from the game. (Characters and Equipment played from his part of your hand stay in play.)

Q: What happens if Wyatt is face-down? What happens if I cancel Wyatt's power via Mutant Control Act? What about Nullifier (or Cosmo, etc.)?

A: Wyatt's power is a triggered power with a set duration. It triggers when he appears and it doesn't turn off until he is removed from play or leaves your side. Therefore, if he is face down, he still has a hand and still draws. 

If his power is negated via Mutant Control Act, it never turns on (unless he leaves play and appears again). If his power is negated after it already triggered (such as via Nullifier or Cosmo after he appeared), the power is unaffected as the modifier is now independent of the power. If the power is Nullified BEFORE he appears, however, it never triggers and he never gets a hand nor resource row.

If he is moved to a different side (such as via Serpent Crown) his hand and resource row are lost for the original player, and now the player of the side he's on gets a hand and row. (His hand and row do NOT get moved over from the original player.)

When Xander hides, turn him face down but in the ready orientation. Remove all +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters and Equipment from him. A hidden character doesn’t count as being stunned, but it still can’t attack or defend, it doesn’t protect anyone behind it, and loses its powers. It still keeps its other information like name and team affiliation. If a hidden character gets stunned somehow, change it to the stunned orientation (face down and exhausted). A hidden character will turn face up the same time your stunned characters would recover.

When this Plot Twist resolves, it cancels the combat. It then acts as though the player whose turn it is just said, "Okay, I'm done with my turn." And then, anything that triggers "At the end of the turn" will trigger, and the rest of the end-of-turn procedure will happen normally.
