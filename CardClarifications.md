# Card clarifications and FAQs

The following card-specific information is a culmination of clarifications, rule changes, and FAQs from various sources. After each item (or series of items), there's a "Source" indicator that specifies whether the item came from:
* Rule inserts from the set
* An official FAQ doc published by Upper Deck Entertainment (UDE FAQ)
* An official rule change, clarification, or errata
* A community source, such as Facebook or Discord. (Some of these have been officially approved by UDE and, if so, are noted in the source citation). 

**Note**: There have been some minor editorial liberties taken (not all are exact quotations from the main source). These changes are mainly cosmetic or made to help understand context outside of the rule-sheet and do not fundamentally change the intent of the original text.

# [Abduction](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-037.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^XFB-037

*Set: The X-Files Battles*

The abducted character will re-enter the game with wound counters on it equal to its printed health minus one. So if it has 3 printed health, it will re-enter the game with two wounds. **Note:** This won't trigger any powers that look for "when a character gets wounded**.

# [Abomination](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu1-033.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MCU1-033

*Set: MCU Battles*
  
Abomination’s **Give Me a Real Fight!** Power forces a player’s first attack to include a specific character and the defender must be Abomination. However if either that character can’t attack or Abomination can’t be attacked, the effect does nothing. Also, the player can choose not to attack at all on their turn.

# Adam Cole
^CardNumber: ^AEW-030, ^AEW-031

*Set: AEW* 
 
**Bay Bay!** counts characters' printed powers including ![](%%Flight%%) or ![](%%Range%%).

^(Source: Rule insert)

# Adam Page
^CardNumber: ^AEW-001, ^AEW-002

*Set: AEW* 
 
**Buckshot Lariat** dazes enemy characters, which means they get stunned but don't gain wounds. "Could melee attack" means Adam Page must be able to attack them (for example Adam Page must be in the front row, can't be exhausted, and the enemy character can't be protected).

# Adam Warlock
## [Adam Warlock](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-001.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: ^GAL-001, ^GAL-002

*Set: Galactic Guardians* 
 
At [Level 1](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-001.jpg), if Adam Warlock gets KO'd by getting stunned, **Prepare for Rebirth** will cause him to gain an XP and become [Level 2](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-002.jpg) while in the stunned position. (If a power like Hex prevents him from leveling up, he'll remain at Level 1 but still heal his wounds.)

## [Adam Warlock](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-074.jpg) (SC)
^CardNumber: ^MNB-074

*Q: If I don’t use his Emerge power, will he recover normally during my next Recovery Phase?*

A: Yes. But he’s huge! Spend that ![](%%Might%%) (Might) and start bashing with him right away, man!

^(Source: UDE FAQ - UDE Approved 6/10/2016)

# Afterlife Transporter
^CardNumber: ^FFO-023

*Set: Frightful Foes*

This equipment has the Fantastic and Frightful team symbols separated by a slash. This means you may have either a face-up Fantastic OR a face-up Frightful character to play it.

^(Source: Rule Insert)

# [Agamotto](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MYS-014.jpg) 
^CardNumber: ^MYS-014

*Set: Mystic Arts*

Scenario: My opponent takes over one of my SCs with Serpent Crown. I then play Agamotto which removes powers not printed on the card. I'm confident that the opponent isn't returned to me outright (because that trigger has already resolved).

> After the recent rules revision, the powers on Serpent Crown no longer "count" as being on the equipped character. As such, Agamotto will not remove those powers (since he only affects characters, not equipment.)

> In other words, playing Agamotto will not return the stolen character to you.

But what about the second part of the  **Under Set's Control** power (When this is unequipped...)? Is that considered a Trigger or a Delayed Trigger Modifier? If it's a Trigger, I assume that this character now remains on my opponent's side, even if the Crown is removed. If it's a Delayed Trigger Modifier, I assume that the character remains on my opponent's side indefinitely if the Crown is removed while Agamotto is face up. (Hope that all makes sense.)

> Some technical answers are incoming (but it sounds like that's what you're looking for).

> It's a Delayed Trigger Modifier. Under Set's Control works as follows:

> The first sentence is a triggered effect with two modifiers -- the first is a one-shot modifier that moves the character from one side to another. The second sets up a delayed triggered modifier that waits for the Crown to become unequipped.

Do you have any tips on telling one apart from the other, as they both can contain the "When" clause?

> The visual cue is a paragraph break between the two modifiers. If there's a separation, they are two separate effects each with its own modifier(s). If there's no separation, it's a single effect with multiple modifiers.

> **Example 1: Two separate triggered effects, each with a one-shot modifier.**

> **_Cool Draw + Discard Power_**

> **When this character appears, draw a card.**

> **When this character gets KO'd, discard a card.**

> Player A plays the above character and draws a card.

> Player B plays plays Nullifier and names "_Cool Draw + Discard Power_."

> The character gets KO'd. Since the power is gone, its second sentence won't trigger and the player doesn't have to discard a card.

> **Example 2: One triggered effect which generates one one-shot modifier and one delayed trigger modifier.**

> **_Cool Draw + Discard Power_**

> **When this character appears, draw a card. When this character gets KO'd, discard a card.**

> Player A plays the above character. The one shot-modifier causes the player to draw a card. The delayed trigger modifier is set up and waits for the character to get KO'd. It exists independently from the effect that generated it.

> Player B plays Nullifier and names "_Cool Draw + Discard Power_."

> The character gets KO'd. The power is gone, but the delayed trigger modifier exists separately from the power, so it will still trigger and the player will discard a card.

Q: If my supporting character has a a Vitality counter and gets stunned while my opponent has Agamotto in play, does that character get wounded or do you just remove the Vitality counter?

A: Although the vitality counter does not actually add to the character's health total, it still cancels out a wound.

***The All Seeing*** power makes it so that any modifiers increasing the ATK/ DEF or Health of an enemy character do not apply to the character. This does not remove the sources of those modifiers like in the case of the Ancient One providing +1 health or the quinjet providing +3/+3. Although the Vitality counters are no longer giving the character in question + health, they still exist just like in the *Gorgon* example below [See FB Post]. So the rules surrounding the removal and application of counters are still affecting the game.

# [Agatha Harkness](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-013.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FAN-013

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

If Agatha appearing on your side KOs an Agatha that was already on your side (due to uniqueness), **Ancient Sorceress** will count the Agatha that was KO'd.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# Agent Venom (Level 2 MC)
^CardNumber: ^LET-006

*Set: Lethal Protector*  

This character has a **"Level Down"** power. A **Level Down** Power works just like a **Level Up** Power, except instead of gaining XP which advances it to a higher level, it gains XP which regresses it back to a lower level. When a character gains **Level Down** XP, put an XP counter on its Main Character card that is one level lower than its current level.

**Note** Agent Venom has 6 Health, representing his increased durability and life force of the Symbiote. But Flash by himself only has 5 Health, so if Agent Venom has 5 wounds and Levels Down, Flash will get KO'd.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# Agony and Riot
^CardNumber: ^LET-009, ^LET-007

*Set: Lethal Protector*  

These characters have "stun" powers: **Assassin** and **Warrior** respectively. If they trigger their power, but area lso stunned at the same time, they **will** get their +1/+1 counters.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Ahab](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FUT-023.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FUT-023

*Set: Futures Past*

You start the game with a private out-of-game Hound pile. The pile must contain exactly 4 different supporting characters of your choice with (Brotherhood), (Resistance), and/or (X-men) ~~who do not share any names and do not have any copies in your deck~~ who are not already in your deck and do not share any names with each other or characters in your deck. For the game, Hounds lose their printed team affiliations, and gain the (Sentinel) affiliation.

Note: the above rules insert was ammended via the Out of Game Piles document.

^(Source: Rule Insert), ^([Out of Game Piles Doc](http://www.upperdeck.com/op/))

Q: Do I have to reveal the Hound when I recruit it?

A: Yes. When Ahab appears, choose a Hound, reveal it to all other players, and then put it into your hand.

# [Ajax](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-012.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MFM-012

*Set: Deadpool & Friends*  

Ajax's **Pain Tolerance** power says he can only be KO'd by fatal wounds at the end of a turn. A character has fatal wounds if it has at least as many wounds as its health. So Ajax can have any amount of wounds but won't actually get KO'd until the end of a turn.

^(Source: Rule insert)

---

Q: Does his power imply that fatal wounds at the end of the turn is the ONLY way to KO him? For example, if a character power or card effect would KO him directly (such as Simon Trask's Human Sentinel One), is he still KO'd?

A: Fatal wounds can’t KO him until end of turn. Other effects (like Simon Trask) can KO him normally.

# [Alcatraz](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HAM-019.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^HAM-019

*Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.*  

When the character in “prison” turns face up, the player who used Alcatraz decides which row on its original side it goes back to.

# Alex Krycek
## [Alex Krycek (MC)](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-022.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^XFB-022, ^XFB-023

*Set: The X-Files Battles*

**Fight or Die** can choose any random Main Character, even ones not in the combat. WE suggest rolling a die to determine which character gets stunned. If Kryceck gets stunned this way, he will get removed from combat. If a stunned Main Character is chosen, nothing happens. If a hidden Main Character is chosen, stun it.

## [Alex Krycek (SC)](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-033.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^XFB-033

*Set: The X-Files Battles*

**We All Have a Life in Our Hands** says to choose a unique character. This counts any character that doesn't have **Swarm**. To secretly choose a character we suggest jotting its name down on a piece of paper. **Note:** If the character you chose gets KO'd but then later another character with the same name is in play, the new character does NOT count for **We All Have a Life in Our Hands**.

# [Alicia Masters](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-009.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FAN-009

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Here's an example of how her **Neo-Realistic Sculptor** works. The Thing is on your side, who has 10/6 ATK/DEF. While Alicia is also on your side, his ATK/DEF become  10/10.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Alien Symbiote](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SPF-021.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^SPF-021

*Set: Spider Friends*

>If a character that is equipped with the Alien Symbiote gains an equipment card, put the Alien Symbiote in the KO pile.

The text on Alien Symbiote says that it cannot be KO'd but the One-Equip rule in the rule book will override this text if the character is equipped with another equipment card.  Cards must explicitly (not implicitly) override game mechanics and this was ruled that it was not intended to override the one-equipment rule.

# [Alter Ego](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MCU7-019.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MCU7-019

*Set: Friendly Neighborhood*  

"Make up a new name" means you must rename a character card with something that is not already the name of a character in the Vs System 2PCG. Some examples of made-up names are "Night Monkey", "Dr. Baby", and "The Fudge".

Removing a character's current names (which also makes the character lose all its **AKA**s) and replacing it lets you get around the uniqueness rules. For example, if you change Spider-Man's name to Night Monkey, you can now play or have another copy of that Spider-Man cad in play at the same time since they have different names. (On the other hand, you can no longer discard a Spider-Man character to power up Night Monkey.)

If a character references itself in its text box, those references will also use its new name.

Q: So, I know that Alter Ego can't give a character a name that already exists. However, can I use part of a name that already exists? For example, could I rename a character as "Ultra Captain America" and thereby be able to use The Greatest Symbol plot twist with that character?

A: Alter Ego can be used to create a new name for a character that does not already exist within the game.

This name can include the words "Captain America". That would then allow The Greatest Symbol to reduce the cost of that character's super power. 

(**Editor's Note:** The Greatest Symbol only requires a character with "Captain America" in its name to play the card - it doesn't have to be used for that character specifically. This ruling would also allow you to play the Captain America's Shield equipment on a character you renamed as mentioned above.)

---

Q: Q: What if I use Alter Ego to rename a character to, "Black Widow, Hawkeye, Hulk, Iron Man, and Thor". Can that satisfy the condition for abilities like MCU Captain America's **Assemble the Team**?

A: Though you could use this name, it doesn't satisfy the condition for multiple characters. There must still be individual characters with each of those names.

# [Angel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/RES-001.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: ^RES-001, ^RES-002

*Set: Resistance*  

When Angel levels up, he transforms into [Archangel](#wiki_archangel). When this happens, he keeps his orientation (ready/exhausted, face-up/face-down), all of his counters, and any effects on him. Also note Archangel doesn’t have a Level 1 version. The only way to become him normally is to start the game with (Resistance) Level 1 Angel as your Main Character.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Angel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-001.jpg)/[Angelus](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-028.jpg) (MC) 
^CardNumber: ^TBB-001, ^TBB-028

*Set: The Buffy Battles*  

Level 1 Angel and Angelus can transform between each other. However, when you build a deck you must choose either Angel or Angelus to be your starting Main Character. (You must lock in your decision at the time you build your deck, not after you see what Main Character your opponent is using.) When Angel transforms into Angelus or vice versa, he keeps his orientation (ready/exhausted, face up/face down), all of his counters (including XP), and any effects on him.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Angela](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-015.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^GAL-015

*Set: Galactic Guardians*  

**An Angel From the Heavens** makes it difficult for Angela to be solo attacked. An attacker must have ![](%%Flight%%) or ![](%%Range%%) (or both) to solo attack her. 

When Angela opens a **Bridge to Heven**, you must put each revealed character onto your side. This may cause some characters to be KO'd due to the uniqueness rules.

# Angry Beasts (Terrain)
^CardNumber: ^CV4-027

*Set: Crossover Vol. 4* 

Besides being angry, the wolves are very smart, and good listeners. If there is a tie for the lowest DEF in his row, the player who placed the wolves chooses who to put the -1/-1 counters on.

# A Nightmare Made Real
^CardNumber: ^NBX-021

*Set: The New Brotherhood*  

The effect of this Plot Twist lasts until your next turn. So attackers strike with double their ATK on your turn. And then attackers strike with double their ATK on each other player's turn.

# [Annihilus](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FRI-001.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FRI-001, ^FRI-002

*Set: The Frightful*

**Lord of the Negative Zone** allows you to include up to two Negative Zone Locations in your deck. (If Mister Fantastic is in your deck your Invention pile will also include its usual two Negative Zones.)

**The Living Death That Walks** grants 1 XP for each of the listed actions. So if Annihilus attacks, strikes, and stuns a defending character, but somehow doesn't wound or KO it, he will gain 3 XP.

When Annihilus levels up, you'll shuffle his Level 1 card into your deck. While it's in your hand you may reveal it for his **Continuous Rebirth** power. (You can also discard it to Power Up Annihilus. Put the discarded card into your Level Up zone, which is where his Level 2 card started the game.

# [Anti-Venom](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/LET-016.jpg)

^Source: [^Upper ^Deck ^Blog](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2022/01/vs-system-2pcg-organized-play-post-symbiotes-arc-update/)

# \*Ant-Man\*
^CardNumber: ^FND-001, ^FND-002

Starting on your 4th turn **Uh-Oh** allows you to reveal your hand during you Build Phase. If you reveal at least one Human Torch, Invisible Woman, Mister Fantastic, and Thing character, you will put ALL characters with those names from your hand on the bottom of your deck.

Example: \*And-Man\* is Level 1. It's your 5th turn's Build Phase. You have one Invisible Woman, two Mister Fantastics, three Things, and two Human Torches (one of which is Invisible Boy AKA Human Torch). You reveal your hand and put all 8 of those cards on the bottom of your deck. Then you draw 8 cards, shuffle your deck, and \*Ant-Man\* gains 1 XP. 

**The Fantastic Four Are Missing's** effect goes away once **The Fantastic Four Return** happens. So after that you can have individual human Torch, Invisible Woman, etc. characters appear on your side.

If Ardina appears via some mechanism other than being recruited (such as being brought along by Lockjaw or Legacy), you do not have to pay the additional cost of wounding Silver Surfer.

# Arnim Zola
## [Arnim Zola](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-001.jpg) (MC-Illustrated)
^CardNumber: ^CV1-001, ^CV1-002

*Set: Crossover* 
 
**ESP Box** takes effect once the game starts and lasts the whole game (even while Arnim Zola is stunned, after he levels up, and even after he is KO’d). You can play any Equipment as a Supporting Character, regardless of whether you have a character with a matching team affiliation. When you play one as a Supporting Character, it’s no longer an Equipment. If it has a power that references “Equipped Character,” it is its own equipped character. When the card leaves play it will go back to being an Equipment. You may still play an Equipment normally and equip it to one of your characters (including on an Equipment that you played as a Supporting Character). 

When Arnim Zola enters **A New Robot Body**, your new Equipment-turned-Main Character will have ATK/DEF equal to its cost, 1 (Health), Swarm, and it will count as its own “Equipped Character,” just like with ESP Box. When that body gets KO’d, it can use this power again to jump into another robot body, and so on. Note: if you want to use a Wild Special Location to pay for this power, it must match the team affiliation of the Main Character using this power.

Q: If I **Hypnotize** a Ripley #8 L2 that started the game as Sister Ripley, which Level 1 Character does she become? Sister Ripley or Ripley#8 level 1?

A: Ripley #8 Level 1. A character will always become the level one version of what it is.  

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel)

Q: Does **Hex** prevent a **Hypnotized** character from turning back into Level 2 at the start of my next turn?

A: No, Hypnotize creates a modifier with an expiration that temporarily makes a character its Level 1 version. When that modifier expires it becomes its Level 2 version again, and this is not considered Leveling up.

To resolve the **Age of Miracles**, first choose a Supporting Character with 1 printed Health other than Baron von Strucker. Then randomly select one of the six new Keyword Powers. that character gains the new power until it leaves play. (To randomly select a power, we recommend rolling a 6-sided die where 1 is **Dark** and 6 is **Wise**.)

**Note:** If you use **Age of Miracles** more than once on the same character, it's possible for them to get the same power twice. This is great with **Dark** and **Sly**, but not great with the other powers.

# [Blackbird](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/DAR-017.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^DAR-017

*Set: Into the Darkness*

The Blackbird introduces a new kind of equipment to the game - Vehicles! When you play a Vehicle, equip it to one character like normal. But whenever you rearrange your Formation (including on the turn you played the Vehicle), you may have characters on your side get on or off the Vehicle. Choose any number up to the Vehicle's Passenger Limit (found next to "Vehicle" on its type line), put them next to each other in the same row, and equip the Vehicle to all of them. Here are more details:

- All passengers must legally be able to have the Vehicle equipped.
- If any already had an equipment, KO that equipment (because a character can only have one equipment at a time). 
	- If an equipment gets equipped to a passenger, it stops being equipped to the Vehicle, but the Vehicle is not KO'd as long as it has any other passengers.
- When you rearrange your Formation, you CAN remove passengers from the Vehicle. (They stop having it equipped to them.)
- When you're done rearranging, there must be at least one passenger.
- Put the Vehicle card close to each of its passengers and announce who is "on board."

**While a Vehicle has only one passenger, it works just like any other equipment.** If its passenger gets turned face down or leaves play, the Vehicle will get KO'd. If an effect moves the passenger to a different row, the Vehicle will move with them.

**While a Vehicle has more than one passenger, it works a little differently.** If a passenger gets turned face down or leaves play, it becomes unequipped from the Vehicle, but the Vehicle remains equipped to the other passenger(s). If all passengers do get turned face down or leave play at the same time, they all become unequipped from the Vehicle and the Vehicle gets KO'd. 

If an effect moves all passengers to a different row, the Vehicle goes with them. If an effect causes one or more passengers to be in one row and the others to be in a different row, the controller of the Vehicle chooses which group of passengers stays equipped to the Vehicle.

The X-Jet has up to four effects depending on how many passengers it has. For example, while there are exactly three face-up passengers, they will each have ![](%%Flight%%) (Flight) , +1/+1 and **Dodge**. If one passenger becomes unequipped, then the other two will now have ![](%%Flight%%) (Flight) and +1/+1.

*Set: Monsters Unleashed!*  

Black Bolt’s Super Powers use the Amplify ability. When you use a Super Power, if you discard a Location (instead of turning it face-down in your resource row), you get the Amplify text. Previous Amplify Super Powers grant an effect to begin with but a larger effect if you Amplify it. Black Bolt’s powers only grant an effect if you Amplify them.

Q: If I use Black Bolt's **Sonic Whisper** and Black Bolt is Lethal (by playing "A Killer Voice" for example), will the opponent be KO'd?

A: If you are attacking, yes. Lethal only activates when attacking and when you cause a wound. Because **Sonic Whisper** is a combat ability, and stunning causes a wound, the opponent will be KO'd (barring any other effects that prevent the wound, etc.).

Q: If Satana is in play and Black Cat attacks a defender and uses **Cross their Path** to Daze that character, is it KO'd by Lethal?

A: Daze counts as stunning, but Lethal was changed to work when a wounding a defending supporting character. Since Daze does not wound, lethal is not applied.

**Personal Loyalty**  
Black Cat has often wavered between being a hero and a villain. In the game she doesn’t have a team affiliation and is neither Good nor Evil… until she’s on a side (she is neither Good nor Evil while she is in your hand, deck, or KO pile). Then if Spider-Man is your main character, he has a good influence on her and she’ll ferociously fight alongside her partner. But if he’s not your main character, she’ll go back to slinking around as a criminal.

**Immovable Object**

We figure you have more questions about all this, so let’s dive in.

Q: What happens if he’s team attacking and I use his power, but then he gets stunned before the combat resolves?

A: His power will still trigger and stun the defender even though Cable himself got stunned before the combat resolved. This is because once an effect resolves and creates a modifier, it is independent from the source that created it.

**Primordial Power**  
(Infinite) ATK means the Champion will always have enough ATK to stun a defender and his DEF will always be high enough to avoid getting stunned by a defender's strike. Although if somehow, the defender also has infinite ATK and DEF, then both characters will get stunned. (In other words, infinite ATK is treated as equal to infinite DEF which results in a stun. It's maths.)

**Come Work For Me** will count when a character turns face up either because it was hidden or because it was stunned and recovered. If CSM is turned face up at the same time as other characters on your side, he will 'see' them and gain XP for them.

**Every Problem Has a Solution** counts Keyword, Super, and Level Up text powers with the word "can" or "can't" in their definition, even if the definition isn't printed on the card. (For example, the keyword **Dodge** doesn't always have its definition on a card but it means "This character can't be ranged attacked.") "Text powers" means this power doesn't affect ![](%%Flight%%)or ![](%%Range%%). It also counts text powers that are granted to a card from another source, like a Plot Twist or an Equipment, but that aren't printed on the card itself.

**Note:** If a power says "This power can't be turned off.", **Every Problem Has a Solution** will try to take it away (because it says "can't") but it won't be able to do so.

Q: I know that a face-down character can't have or gain -1 counters, but can it be the TARGET of a power that would grant -1/-1 counters? Specifically with Cloak MC, for instance, if all enemies are face-down, can his power still target one of those face-down characters? (But of course it wouldn't actually get added to them.)

A: Cloak does not specify face up so a face down character is a legal target for the ability.  This will result in no counters being placed unless Nightmare supporting character is face up and in play.

> If multiple characters "appear" at once, Copycat is unable to copy any of them.

With the reveal of Copycat, the question arose on her interaction with [Singularity](https://i.imgur.com/3vlwcdR.jpg).  Specifically, if multiple characters (other than Copycat) appear at once, which SC's powers, if any, does Copycat inherit?  The ruling is that if multiple triggers occur simultaneously for Copycat, she will not gain any powers.  The reasoning is that she only gains powers "until another supporting character appears on your side."  This means that when multiple characters appear at once, the duration of her effect has already expired by the time it resolves.  From head judge: "if a modifier’s duration would cause it to expire before it is created, then the modifier is never created."  Ultimately, Copycat needs only a single character to appear in order to resolve as intended.

Q: Question that came up about how Copy Cat interacts with Mary Walker.

Take this scenario: 

1. You recruit Copy Cat. 
2. You recruit Mary Walker with Composite Personality.
3. Now Copy Cat has Composite Personality.

The question is, does CC even do anything? Does it now read:

> Copy Cat has all of the powers of cards named “Copy Cat” in your KO pile”

OR

> Copy Cat has all of the powers of cards named “Mary Walker” in your KO pile

I say it’s the latter, because the “Mary” is the self referential part. The “Mary Walker” is the condition it is pointing to. But I’m not confident in that.

A:The end result is it gives Copycat the following: 

> Copy Cat has all of the powers of cards named Mary Walker in your KO pile.

(In other words, as you mentioned the phrase “cards named Mary Walker” is not self-referential.)

Q: If I target a location with C.O.S., can enemy characters still use wild locations in their resource row to pay for their powers if that wild has the same symbol of the location I chose?

A: C.O.S.'s power says “Enemy characters can’t use locations in their resource row with that type to pay for super powers.” This specifically is talking about basic locations, so the enemy character CAN use wild locations in their resource row to pay for their powers. "Type" is referring to the type of symbol produced (Might, Energy, Humanity, etc.). However, keep in mind this is only inhibiting the resource row and players can still discard from hand to pay for super powers.

Q: If I play a red Cosmic Cube and call "Sentinel," for example, would it remove both Alpha Combat Units and Executive Types? Or what if I called "Captain America"? Would it remove Nomad or Supreme Leader? 

A: The Cosmic Cubes mention that you can choose a card and then "... remove any number of cards with that name... " (from where depends on the specific Cube). So, the "name" in this case would include:

- Cards with the title that matches the card you chose.
- Cards with **AKA** that matches the name of the card you chose.
- **BUT NOT** cards with a mantle that sounds like the name of the card you chose.

Sounds confusing? It kind of is. [Check out this infographic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11W764QPzEByqs-LJoICGQuArPRwur_A_/view?usp=sharing) for a visual example of how this does or doesn't apply.

Q: If my opponent has H.A.M.M.E.R. Cloak on his side and I play Dagger, is she KO'd by him before she can convert the -1 counters to +1?

A: She is not KO'd. She would get the +1 counters. Here are the steps when a character is recruited:

1. Announce the name of the character.
2. The character moves from whatever zone that it is in to the Resolving Zone. At this point it is considered “recruited”.
3. If any power would trigger off a character being recruited, resolve that effect, then continue. 
4. The character moves from the Resolving Zone to the Play Zone. 
5. Any powers are now active. 
6. Process any “appears with” text. 
7. At this point the character has now appeared.

So, as of step 5, Dagger's powers are active.

Cloak's power doesn't technically trigger until right after step 7.

**Radar Sense**  
Daredevil, Rhino, and Juggernaut have effects that allow an enemy *character* to spend a power symbol to do something.

**Protector of Hell's Kitchen**

Q: If I attack Daredevil with Mary Walker (Typhoid Mary) and I put a -1/-1 counter on Daredevil and one on the only character he's protecting which happens to have 1 defense (like Black Widow), KO'ing her, does Daredevil gets an XP?

A: The turn player decides the order per the rule book under "Timing." Daredevil's level up power has an intervening "if" clause, which means the condition must be true when it triggers AND when it resolves. So if the turn player decides to resolve Mary Walker's power before Daredevil's power, Daredevil will not get an XP because he won't be protecting anyone once his level up power resolves. On the other hand, if the turn player decides to resolve Daredevil's power before Mary's then Daredevil will gain an XP.

Q: Dark Beast SC2. "Pay 2 less to play evil equipment." Outside of Darkhold, how does one define "evil" equipment?

A: [Good or Evil](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/good_or_evil) affiliations are typically based on the [Team Affiliation](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_team_affiliation) of the card. 

For example: Power Loader would be Good because it has The Company team affiliation, but Omega Machine would be Evil because it is H.A.M.M.E.R. affiliated.

However, for this specific question it should be noted that Darkhold is neutral. It does require you to have a Marvel character, but Marvel isn't a Team Affiliation and doesn't make the card Good or Evil. So Darkhold - even though it can only be equipped to an Evil character -  is not Evil itself (and would *not* benefit from Dark Beast's power).

When Deconstructs the Universe, an entire concept of the game gets removed for the rest of the game (even if she leaves play). If, as a result of this, the wording of a card’s power is unclear, the part that is unclear does nothing. Here’s how removing each concept works: 

* **+1/+1 and -1/-1 counters:** Remove all of those counters from the game. Remove the phrases “+1/+1 counter” and “-1/-1 counter” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause these counters to enter the game in any way

This also includes any cards that were once Equipment cards but don’t currently count as Equipment (such as a face-down resource or an Equipment that has become a character via Arnim Zola’s   
**ESP Box** ). Remove the term “Equipment” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Equipment to enter the game in any way.  

* **Keyword text:** Removing this concept doesn’t affect ![](%%Flight%%) and ![](%%Range%%). Remove all Keyword text from the game, including powers that “can’t be turned off”. Remove the term “Keyword” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Keyword text to enter the game in any way.  
 
* **Levels:** All Main Characters everywhere become Level 1 if possible. Remove all remaining Level 2 and higher Main Characters from the game. Remove all Level Up Powers and XP from the game, and the terms “Level” and “XP” from all card text. Ignore any effects that would cause XP or a Level 2 or higher Main Character to enter the game in any way.  

* **Plot Twists:** Remove all Plot Twist cards everywhere from the game. This includes all decks, hands, KO piles, and Plot Twists that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Plot Twist cards but are not currently Plot Twists (such as a face-down resource). Remove the term “Plot Twist” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause a Plot Twist to enter the game in any way.

Q: If a player calls keywords with ***Deconstruct the Universe***, are you able to play Spell plot twists without a spellcaster or without playing the power symbol?

Anyhoo, the powers that be want me to tell you that even though I’m now on two different main character cards, the (X-Men) and (Underworld) versions of me can’t level up into each other.

You know all the cards in this set that you love? That’s right -- I designed them. (All the cards that you hate were designed by those other two dummies.) Designing stuff is sweet. You can pretty much do whatever you want.  
> 
> I like designing so much, I wanted to do some while I was in the game too. My new main character can **nerf** stuff, **errata** stuff, and even **ban** stuff. Check it out:  

**I'm Taking Over From These Idiot Designers**  
  
* **Nerf:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks, and KO piles are 0/1 with 1 and nothing can ever, ever change that.  

* **Errata:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles lose and can’t gain powers (including ![](%%Flight%%) and ![](%%Range%%)). 
 
* **Ban:** Name a character and choose a number. Put all supporting characters with that name on enemy sides into their owner’s hands. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles have a cost equal to the chosen number and nothing can ever, ever change that. (Except banning it again. You know the old saying: “If you really, really hate a card, ban it twice.”) Any effects that would increase or decrease what an enemy player pays to recruit a banned card are ignored.  

Here are some quick tips:  

* If you steal a character with one of those effects the effect will stop because it’s not an enemy character anymore. Yay! However, if it goes back to an enemy side the effect will turn on again. Boo!  

* When you Ban a character, you can name any number you want. Even a million bazillion. Try it, it’s fun!

* If someone tries to tell you that this isn’t really how nerfing, errata-ing, and banning works, you just take your katana and do some "development” on them, if you know what I mean.

A: It goes on you. If this puts you to 0 DEF, you’ll get stunned (and KO’d). If it makes your stats better, that could help you survive this attack and will stick around to help you if he attacks you again on a later turn.

Q: What if I get KO’d?

A: You’re out of the game, the same way as if your Main Character got KO’d. (You do not actually lose consciousness.)

Q: After Deadpool uses his **Oh, there’s Someone! Hi there!** power, can he team attack a player?

A: No, the other characters don’t know what a player is.

Q: If I have both Silver Sable and Deadpool, can they both enter a team attack with my Main Character?

A: No, For a team attack to be legal, all characters have to be on the same team or legal to attack with each other. Deadpool & Silver Sable are not on the same team and can only team attack with Main Characters, not each other.

# [Death](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-001.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^BLK-001, ^BLK-002
*Set: Black Order*  

Death is **Amortal** which means:

* She has no level (She is beyond such mortal trappings).  
* She starts with her card that has infinite health. (Her other card has 8 health, also known as sideways infinity.)  
* She can't be face down. If she would be turned face down, switch her with her other card instead and leave it face up. For example when she gets stunned, instead of turning her face down, switch her with her other card which will remain face up. She still suffers other effects from the stun such as losing the +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters, gaining a wound, and becoming exhausted.  
* If she would be hidden, instead switch her with her other card which will remain face up and place her in the ready position.  
* Amortal can't be turned off.
 
Since Death doesn't turn face down, she can be stunned multiple times in a single turn. However, if she takes fatal wounds she's not really defeated. She's just temporarily lost interest in this mortal battle. (The player who was using her is defeated, though.) 

**Note:** While death is technically two cards, you could slip her into a single clear card sleeve with her cards back to back. Then when she would turn face down, you can just flip her to her other "side."  

**Mistress of the Infinity Well** allows each player to draw an extra card each time you draw cards. For example, when you draw your usual two cards during your Draw Phase, you'll draw an extra one. And if you have a **Genius** in play that lets you draw a card, you'll draw an extra one then, too.

NOTE: 

She starts with her card that has infinite health. (Her other card has 8 health. Also known as sideways infinity. The infinite health side represents that she can never really be killed. But as her other side has 8 health, if she ever has 8 or more wounds on either side, KO her.)

When Devil-Slayer and the defender strike each other: 

* Devil-Slayer can be stunned as normal.  
* A hidden character can get stunned as normal. (Wound it and change it from ready to exhausted.) 
* If Devil-Slayer’s strike would stun an already-stunned character, just wound it instead.

Q: I have Devil-Slayer. My opponent has a stunned character in their back row and a face-up character in their front row. Can Devil-Slayer attack the stunned character in the back row? I'm asking because the comp rules state that a stunned character "can't be protected".

A: No. Devil Slayer still has to follow all the other legal attack rules. He doesn't have ![](%%Flight%%) so he can't ignore the front row.

Q: What if Devil-Slayer is attacking but the defender is dazed prior to combat resolution. For example, if Devil-Slayer is equipped with a Tranquilizer Gun and dazes a defender that has a super power. Is Devil-Slayer able to follow-through and wound the face-down character?

A: No. Per the rules for [Stun](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_stun.2Fstunned):

> If a character gets stunned by an effect during combat but before the combat resolves, it is removed from the combat.

So at the point it is dazed, it is removed from the combat and Devil-Slayer isn't able to "follow-through" with the attack.

^CardNumber: ^FAN-045

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*   

Q: Does “an exact replica” trigger once for each Doombot in play. I.e. I have MC Doom and two Doombots on my side. Doom is stunned and would be wounded. An exact replica triggers on one of my two Doombots and the MC Doom is the random card chosen. Before he would be wounded, does the second Doombots keyword trigger and I pick another card at random to have the chance to potentially prevent the wound a second time?

A: First thing to know is it, is NOT a trigger. A trigger will ALWAYS start with the words, "When, Whenever, At". This is a replacement power. In short, you can try once per Doombot.

If there are multiple Doombots, that means there are multiple modifiers trying to replace the same event. If there are multiple replacement modifiers trying to apply to the same event, you choose one to apply.

If after you processed the replacement modifier, the event no longer happens, then the rest of the replacement modifiers do nothing. If the event still would happen, then you apply another replacement modifier. You keep doing this until the event no longer happens, or you have ran out of replacement modifiers.

In the case of Doombot, the event in question is Doctor Doom being wounded. As long as he is still being wounded, you may continue to try to apply replacement modifiers.

# Doop
^CardNumber: ^HOX-054

*Set: House of X*   

While Doop is **Watching the Game** his card should be facing out from your hand so your opponents can see him (and so he can see the game!). He still counts as being in your hand (and not on your side). For example, you could recruit him normally (putting him onto your side), effects could make you discard him, or you could discard him to power up another Doop that's in play.

While Doop is wathing the game, he can't attack. However he can **be** attacked if:

 - All characters in your front and back row are face down and
 - The attacker(s) has at least 7 ATK.

When he gets attacked, discard him. (This happens right away. For example, players won't be able to play Plot Twists and the attacker(s) doesn't "strike" Doop.)

You may only have one Doop **Watching the Game** at a time. If another Doop starts watching the game from your hand, turn the first one back around so it's in your hand normally.

**Resident of Marginalia** causes a player to skip one of their next phases. In this case, treat that phase as if it doesn't exist on that turn. **Note:** If a player skips their Draw Phase, any "start of turn" effects will occur at the start of their Recovery Phase. Similarly, if a player skips their Main Phase, any "end of turn" effects will occur at the end of their Build Phase.

# Doppelganger

- Title/Names
- Modifiers
- Counters
- Powers not printed on the card. (Like if the card gained a power from an Equipment, etc.)

Whether the card is face down doesn't matter.

*Set: A-Force* 

Q: Do "Appears" powers work when character are brought into play with Dramatic Entrance? I'm not sure because it says, "put into play."

A: It does not matter how a character enters play. If it goes from not being in play, to being in play, it has "appeared" whether that is from recruiting, or some other effect putting it into play.

Q: How does Dramatic Entrance work if I bring a Loki 7 drop SC into play with it? Does Loki draw me a card if it was the first PT I played that turn? Or since it wasn't in play, it doesn't grant me the benefit? If it doesn't, then does the next PT I play that turn trigger Loki's Schemer power?

A: If you bring in Loki SC with Dramatic Entrance, Schemer will not trigger. At the time you PLAYED the plot twist, Loki was not in play. Once he is in play, he does not look back in time and see that you played a plot twist. Also if you play another plot twist, Schemer will still not trigger because it is not your first plot twist played this turn.

Q: If you dramatic entrance a Wasp or Ant-man can you just Shrink the combat?

Q: If I use Dramatic Entrance to put Adam Warlock into play as the new Defender, what happens since he comes into play stunned due to his **Evolutionary Cocoon**?

A: The original defender is still removed from combat, but since Adam enters play stunned, he can not become the defender, so he will enter play and he will be unable to become the defender. Since there is no defender, the combat will end, at which point, the delayed trigger will trigger and KO Adam Warlock.

# [Even the Odds](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-076.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MNB-076

*Set: The Marvel Battles*

Q: How does this card work?

A: You can use it to “reset” an enemy back to its base stats. You remove all +1/+1 counters from it and any modifiers that were affecting its base ATK and DEF are overridden or suppressed.

^(Source - UDE FAQ)

Q: What happens if after I play Even the Odds on a character to “reset” it, my opponent plays a Plot Twist to increase its ATK?

A: Even the Odds resets a character one time and then has no further effect. So the Plot Twist will work normally.

^(Source - UDE FAQ)

Q: Even the Odds targeting Blackheart. He resets to a 4/4 for the rest of the combat, yes? His power does not turn on until the next combat he becomes involved in?

A: Even the Odds creates a continuous modifier that "suppresses" any other continuous modifier affecting ATK/DEF for THAT COMBAT. The modifiers will "turn back on" after the combat has passed.

Q: If I play Even The Odds on a character with -1/-1 counters does it remove them?

A: No, Even the odds does not remove -1/-1 counters, as it says, it only removes +1/+1 counters.

Q: Hello, a question about the Perfect Organism and Even The Odds. If I use the ability to strike with double of the attack, (**This Thing is Huge! It's...It's Big!** / **[Fearless](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_fearless)**) and my opponent plays Even The Odds, what happen?

A: This **Thing is Huge! It's... It's Big!** does not actually modify the ATK. It is modifying how hard it strikes during combat resolution. Normally when you strike, you strike an equal amount to your ATK. This power (and the Daredevil one) changes the rules of the game so that you are striking with double that amount, or triple with Amplify.

^CardNumber: ^MFM-005, ^MFM-006

*Set: Deadpool & Friends* 
  
Made from Deadpool’s discarded body parts that fused back together into a new person, Evil Deadpool gains XP whenever you discard a character. This includes powering up as well as any effect that causes you to “discard” a card (whether you or your opponent controls the effect).

**Merc With an Evil Mouth**  
Evil Deadpool loves being Evil. That’s why he can grant Evil characters on your side the new keyword, Evil Lethal. Evil Lethal works just like regular Lethal except after you KO the supporting defender you laugh evilly. (If you’re unable to laugh evilly you’ll still resolve the effect as much as possible and KO the defender.)  

**It's Like You, But Eviler!**  
Evil Deadpool’s Level 2 super power puts Good characters into play but turns them Evil and adds the word “Evil” at the beginning of their name. Changing their name DOES affect the uniqueness rules. For example, it would allow you to have “Iron Man” and “Evil Iron Man” on your side at the same time. However, you would not be able to add “Evil” to regular Deadpool because then his name would be “Evil Deadpool” which is the same name as your main character. And Evil Deadpool hates Deadpool anyway.

**Facehuggers and Capturing Characters**   
If you have [Ovomorphs](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/small/ALN-035.jpg) in your deck (the eggs that make Facehuggers), you’ll use the Facehugger Pile. 

* The Facehugger Pile includes three Facehugger token characters and one Extended Incubation card. These cards start the game out of play. (If more than one player is using Ovomorphs, they will each use their own Facehugger Pile.)   
* When an Ovomorph is ready to Hatch, reveal a random card from your Facehugger Pile.  
* If you reveal the Extended Incubation card, the Ovomorph doesn’t open yet. Shuffle the Extended Incubation card back into your Facehugger Pile.  
* If you reveal a Facehugger token character, KO its Ovomorph, put the Facehugger into your Back Row, and it captures an enemy supporting character. (It can capture a face-up or stunned supporting character.)  

“Capture” is a new game action that means:  

 - Remove the Captive card from the game, but keep any wound counters on it.  
 - Put the Captive card next to (or underneath) its Captor to make it clear who its Captor is.  
 - When the Captor leaves play, put its Captive back into play stunned in its owner’s back row.  
 - You may pay an ![](%%Alien%%)(Alien) at the start of your Build Phase. If you do, KO the Facehugger and put its captive into its owner’s KO pile. Then you may put an (Xenomorph) character from your hand into your back row. (This represents the new Xenomorph bursting out of the captive’s chest.)  
 - Note: Put the KO’d Facehugger token back into your Facehugger Pile.

>Fin Fang Foom cannot attack a row if any character in that row is an illegal target

For example, if [Xenomorph Ambusher](https://i.imgur.com/XHtrRFS.jpg) was in the back row, Fin Fang Foom cannot declare an attack on that row due to the Ambusher's "Camouflage" keyword.

^(Source: Official Clarification)

---

> If an effect would remove a defender from the attack when Fin Fang Foom is the attacker, that defender remains removed from the attack even if it did not change rows

This ruling was made to clarify how Fin Fang Foom would interact with cards such as [Dramatic Entrance](https://i.imgur.com/bit8aVS.jpg) or [Uncanny Defense](https://i.imgur.com/unboeQ6.png) that remove a defender from the combat, but may still result in the defender occupying the row that Foom is attacking.  The ruling is that the defender removed by one of these cards is no longer part of the combat.

>The [Massive](https://i.imgur.com/e0WOynY.png) keyword does not combine with special attack declarations such as attacking a [Machine](https://i.imgur.com/Fg27kSk.jpg) or attacking a Location.

Attacking a machine is a special type of attack declaration that can only be done if all conditions are met. (No face up characters in the same row as the machine and the attacker can otherwise legally make an attack on that row.)  This was compared to attacking a location with the keyword on [The Thing That Crawls By Night](https://i.imgur.com/U3yOlXN.jpg).  Attacking a row with Massive is Foom's normal attack mode and does not combine with these special attack declarations.  That said, if Foom attacks a row with a Machine in it, he will simply not strike the Machine.  Foom can choose to make a single target attack on the machine if the other conditions are met allowing him to do so.  This is the same as the power on [The Thing That Crawls By Night](https://i.imgur.com/U3yOlXN.jpg) where if an SC were to gain both powers at once, they could not attack multiple Locations in a player's row.  They would need to either attack the front or back row with Massive or attack a Location with the keyword "Nothing is Too Big For it to Attack!"

^(Source: Official Clarification)

Q: What if Fin Fang Foom is equipped with a Tranquilizer Gun and attacks a row. How does that work?

A: When FFF makes a ranged attack against a row with an equipped Tranquilizer Gun, Tranquilizer Gun's power will trigger once for each defending character that has a super power. Then on each resolution, you'll decide whether or not to stun that particular character with a super power.

Q: In a mirror match does each, "The First Evil" get XP from ***From Beneath You, It Devours***, or can you only get XP from your own activations of the power?

A: When a card references its own name without stating “character(s) named”, it is always referring to itself and only this instance of itself (for situations where multiple cards with the same name are in play). Because ***From Beneath You, It Devours*** refers to itself and says "…for each character put into the KO pile this way." it is specifically looking at its own activation of this power. You will not gain XP from the opponent’s trigger of ***From Beneath You, It Devours***.

# Franklin Richards
## Franklin Richards (MC)
^CardNumber: ^FRF-001, ^FRF-002

*Set: Fractured Family*  

Instead of one deck, Franklin actually gets three! Your Multiverse Adventure pile starts with three complete 60-card decks, each of which must be legal for Franklin to use. (For example, ou can't include any Photographic Universe cards.) These piles are **variable** (you choose which cards to include) and **private** (opponents can't look at their contents).

After you find out what main character your opponent is using, you get to pick which one of your three decks you'll start the game with. While Franklin is Level 2, you'll be able to switch your current deck for one of the remaining ones. And then if you want, you can switch that deck for your last one.

There are some special deckbuilding rules for the Multiverse Adventure pile:

**Each deck CAN have its own piles:** Normally cards in piles can't have their own piles. But each of Franklin's decks is allowed to have its own piles. Just make sure to keep track of which piles go with which deck.

**Each specific card can only be in one deck:** For example, if you put any copies of the 6-cost [Fantastic] Thing in one deck, you can't include any copies of that Thing in the other two decks. However, thi doesn't prevent you from including other versions of the same character. For example, ou could still include the new 5-cost [Pro-Registration] Thing in one of the other decks if you like.

This restriction includes basic locations. So if you put any Fortresses in one deck, you can't put any in another deck. (You could include a basic [MIGHT] location with a different name though.) 

This also applies to the cards in each deck's piles. Fore example, if Brainstorm is in one deck OR one of that deck's piles, none of the other decks or their piles can have any copies of Brainstorm.

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Franklin is one of the most powerful beings in the multiverse. So powerful he has been able to, from a young age, create a **Pocket Universe**. Here's what happens when he does that:

* Move each Character other than Franklin to the side of the playing space. **They are now in a separate part of the game.**
    * A **Pocket Universe** has only front and back rows (no resource row).  
    * When the characters are moved to the **Pocket Universe** they stay in the same rows they were in in the original universe. They keep all their counters and their orientation (ready/exhausted; face up/face down).  
    * The **Pocket Universe** is still in the same overall game as the original universe. So cards don't "appear" or "leave play" when they move from the original universe to the **Pocket Universe** or vice versa.  
    * Cards in the **Pocket Universe** cannot attack or otherwise affect cards in the original universe and vice versa.  
    * The Uniqueness rules don't apply across the **Pocket Universe** and original universe. (For example, you could have a Human Torch in both Universes.)  
    * Note: Your hand, deck, KO pile, and out-of-game piles can be accessed in both the original universe and the **Pocket Universe** (more on this below).  
* Each player who has characters in a **Pocket Universe** will take a separate turn in that **Pocket Universe** after their normal turn (before the next player's normal turn, and including the turn Franklin creates the **Pocket Universe**).  
    * First take your normal turn. During this turn, ignore the **Pocket Universe**.  
    * After your turn is over, you then take a **Pocket Universe** turn. During this turn, ignore the original universe.  
    * The cards you play on a particular turn can only affect that turn's universe.  
* A **Pocket Universe** turn sequence is a little different than a normal turn, as follows:  
    * Start of turn  
        * Note that there is no Draw Phase.  
    * Recovery Phase  
    * Formation Step  
        * Note that there is no Build Phase because there are no Recruit Points or resource rows in the **Pocket Universe**.  
    * Main Phase  
        * This works just like a "Normal" Main Phase in regard to combats.  
        * You can play Plot Twists from our hand to affect a **Pocket Universe**.
        * You can discard Locations from your hand to generate a power symbol in the **Pocket Universe**. (Since the **Pocket Universe** has no resource row, there are no locations to turn face down to generate a power symbol.)  
        * You can discard characters from your hand to Power Up characters in a **Pocket Universe**.
        * When a character is KO'd in a **Pocket Universe**, they go to the normal KO pile. Similarly, if a character leaves play due to an effect, it works the same as if the character were still in the original universe. For example, if an effect returned the character to its owner's hand, it would go to that hand as normal.
    * End of turn
* If there is more than one **Pocket Universe** in the game, each player will take their normal turn first, then a **Pocket Universe** turn for each **Pocket Universe** they have characters in, starting with the first **Pocket Universe** created, then the second, etc.
    * Cards in one **Pocket Universe** cannot attack or otherwise affect cards in another **Pocket Universe**.
* When Franklin leaves play, the characters from each **Pocket Universe** he created pop back into the original universe part of the game, in the same rows and with the same orientation they were in their **Pocket Universe**.
    * If this leads to more than one character with the same name on your side, KO all except one (your choice).

^CardNumber: ^WEB-003, ^WEB-004

*Set: Webheads*  

**You Can Borrow This for a While** grants characters with the chosen name the **Dimensional Wristwatch** keyword. You can recruit a character with **Dimensional Wristwatch** directly from your deck: Announce you're recruiting them from your deck, search your deck for the character, shuffle your deck, and then recruit them (pay its cost and put it onto your side). 

If a character with the chosen name gets put back into your deck somehow it will regain **Dimensional Wristwatch** while it's in your deck.

**Ticket to the Multiverse** lets Ghost-Spider jump from your game to a neighboring game. You must have permission from all players in that game before Ghost-Spider can make the jump into their game.

If no one else is playing near you or you don't have permission to move Ghost-Spider, then remove her from the game until the start of your next turn.

When Ghost-Spider enters another game or gets removed from the game set aside all her counters and Equipment. She will reappear in her original game with those counters and Equipment.

If Ghost-Spider enters another game of Vs. System 2PCG, you decide which player gains control over her. She can attack, gain counters, get stunned, get KO'd, etc., just like in her original game. However, no matter what happens she will go back to her original game at the start of your next turn. When she jumps back, any counters, Equipment, etc. that she gained in the other game will be removed.

If Ghost-Spider enters a game that isn't Vs. System 2PCG, it's up to the players in that game to decide exactly how she works in that game.

Q: Question about Ghost Spider MC's lvl 1 ability **You Can Borrow This for A While**. 

Let's say I name "Spider-Man" - who is a Spider-Friends SC. If I have an Anti-Registration (or Pro-Reg, Avengers, etc.) version of Spider-Man in my deck, does he also get Dimensional Wristwatch? Or is it ONLY the Spider-Friends version? 

The ability specifically says you have to name a Spider-Friends supporting character, but it generically says that "Characters with that name have Dimensional Wristwatch..." (It doesn't specify "Spider-Friends characters with that name...")

A: The named character must a be Spider-Friends team affiliated character, but yes every character with that name in your deck (AKAs have that name) are able to be retrieved with the wrist watch.

*Set: Cosmic Avengers*  

In this Arc, we are playing around with how players can use locations besides super powers. In addition to cards like \* Thor \* and Hyperion (who have keyword powers which requires spending an ![](%%Intellect%%) (Intellect) and ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy), each Issue will have a Plot Twist and Special Location that allow their main characters to have some pretty powerful effects on the game. A few things about these Plot Twists and Special Locations:

* They are not super powers.  
* Your main characters ust be face up to pay for them.  
* Your main characters can use a "Wild" Special Location from their team to pay for them.  
* These cards are neutral, so just like any other neutral cards, they can be in Loyalty decks.  
* The Special Locations don't count as locations with a specific power symbol (for powers like Black Widow Main Character's Level Up power **Red in Her Ledger** or ZZutak's **Paint to Life**).

# God Emperor Doom
^CardNumber: ^FFO-002, ^FFO-003, ^FFO-004

*Set: Frightful Foes*  

**Construct Battleworld** puts the game into the full Battleworld game mode (introduced in Crossover Vol. 3). If God Emperor Doom is your main character, you'll bring and shuffle your own Battleworld pile before the game. This pile is **variable**: you pick 12 different Battleworld Domains to include. And it's **private**: your opponent doesn't get to know what's in it.

**If you're already using the Battleworld game mode**, the players will need a shared Battleworld pile (like usual). However, when God Emperor Doom levels up, his own personal Battleworld pile will replace the shared pile.

**If more than one player is God Emperor Doom**, you'll each have your own Battleworld pile. Once Doom levels up, that Doom's pile will be used for now. Once a second Doom levels up, the game will leave the current Domain and enter the Domain of the top card of the second Doom's Battleworld pile. And so on if there's a 3rd, 4th, etc. God Emperor Doom.

Once there are two or more God Emperor Dooms with "active" Battleworld piles, whenever a defending main character gets wounded, the current Domain wil go to its discard pile, and the game will enter the Domain of the next "active" Battleworld pile (going clockwise). 

If you use **This World is Mine** to stay in the current Domain, it happens before you get to see the next Domain card.

**Note:** Two other cards - The Grandmaster (main character) and the Beyonder each have their own separate Battleworld piles and can have the game enter one of their Domains. When this happens, any other Domain in play will go to its discard pile (like normal). Then once a defending main character gets wounded, the game will enter th Domain of the next "active" Doom Battleworld pile as described above.

Norseheim, a Domain found in the Crossover Vol. 4 issue, causes the game to enter two Domains at once. This will cause **A Patchwork Planet** to give Doom 2 XP. And **God of Battleworld** will turn off the powers of both Norseheim and the other Domain.

**Token Characters**  
Goblin Queen has the power to make token characters. A token character works just like a regular character except that if it ever gets put into a KO pile or otherwise leaves play, remove it from the game.

Q: When a token takes lethal damage, does it become KO'd and count towards Thanos's **The Mad Titan** level up ability?

A: Thanos will gain XP from a Token being KO'd and Tokens will exist for a brief moment in the KO pile before ceasing to exist via the rules of the game. Basically if a token ever ends up in a non play zone, it will cease to exist.

*Set: Mind & Soul*  

When you recruit Goose, you'll pay 1 or more recruit points. When Goose appears, she will swallow up an enemy character or Equipment with that cost. When Goose leaves play, that card will go back to its owner's hand.

If an effect needs to know Goose's cost, treat it as 0 (regardless of how many recruit points you paid). 

**Note:** If Goose appears without getting recruited, her **Internal Pocket Dimension** can only remove a Supporting Character or Equipment with 0 cost.

**The Spear in the East**  
Gorgon’s power removes the stat benefit from +1/+1 counters on enemy characters. They still count as having the counters though. For example, if an enemy character with two +1/+1 counters gains a -1/-1 counter, you’ll still remove one of each counter type.

# The Grandmaster

^CardNumber: ^CV3-005, ^CV3-006

*Set: Crossover Vol. 3*

If the Grandmaster is your main character, you'll need to bring and shuffle your own Battleworld pile before the game. This pile is private and contains your choice of 12 different Battleworld Domains. (Note that you will need a shuffled pile of the 10 Terrain - City cards as well.) When he uses **The Contest of Champions**, the game will enter the top Domain of your pile (just as if you were playing with the Battleworld game mode).

When any defending main character gets wounded, the game will leave that Domain (put the card into a discard pile next to the Battleworld pile). It will NOT automatically enter a new one.

If **Contest of Champions** is used again, the game will enter the next Battleworld Domain. (If the game is already in a Battleworld domain, that one goes to its discard pile.) 

If more than one player has the Grandmaster as their main character, they will each have their own Battleworld pile.

**Who's Having Fun?** put a +1/+1 counter on two different Supporting Characters. If you have one, you'll have to put a +1/+1 on an enemy Supporting Character if possible. With **Contest of Champions** you can choose any two Supporting Characters, even two on the same side.

## [Grandmaster](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/LEG-033.jpg) - Illus SC
^CardNumber: ^LEG-033

*Set: Legacy*  

Q: Does **Elder of the Universe** apply only if Grandmaster is directly involved in the combat? For example, what if my opponent has Grandmaster out and I attack one of their other characters with Carnage (Symbiote). If Grandmaster gets a -1/-1 counter and is stunned, does he get wounded? (Technically, the counter was applied during a combat - just not one that Grandmaster was involved in directly.)

A: During Combat in this case does reference a combat this character is involved in. Generally a “Combat” by itself is referring to combat this character is involved in while “Any Combat” concerns a combat this or any character is involved in.

So, in the above example, Grandmaster would take a wound because it is not during combat from his perspective (he's not directly involved in the combat).

# Green Goblin
## [Green Goblin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-005.jpg) (MC - Sinister Six)
^CardNumber: ^CV1-005

*Set: Crossover*  

The Sinister Six have gained two new Main Characters to choose from. Remember, when you build a Sinister Six deck, you choose any six Sinister Six characters to go with that deck.

Goblin’s **Bag of Tricks** allows you to discard Locations to make him more powerful in combat. If this causes Goblin to strike “before each other character,” this means he strikes first even if any of the characters have, for example, a power like Ferocious. And if two Goblins are in combat with that ability, they’ll strike each other at the same time. If you discard an Oscorp Location, it’s like a wild: you can treat it as though it’s any of the other four Locations that you didn’t already discard this combat.

^CardNumber: ^MMU-053

*Set: Monsters Unleashed*

Q:  When **Magnetokinesis** moves an equipment from a character to another, do any limitations still apply? 

A: Even though the card just says to "move" the equipment, it still counts as being equipped to the new character. Therefore, any equipping restrictions on the equipment (such Ebony Blade can only be equipped to Black Panther or Black Knight) would still apply. 

---

Q: If you move Helmet of Immunity from one character on your side to another with Grid, would you choose a second power symbol and now it blocks both symbols from being used by enemy characters?

A: It does not leave play when it is unequipped. It is equipped to the new character and that will trigger the power which will allow you to choose. HOWEVER, the second part of the power refers to "THAT type" it is singular, it can only refer to the most recent choice. It can't refer to all prior choices made.

Hawkeye's **Custom Quiver** means he starts the game with his 4 different Custom Arrows Plot Twists in his Quiver Pile. Once he's level 2, you may use **I Am the Weapon** to draw a random **Custom Arrows** card each turn. Once a custom Arrow card is in your hand, it acts just like a regular Plot Twist. Note that to be able to play any of them, Hawkeye must be face-up on your side, but for the Combat PlLot Twists he doesn't have to be in the combat himself (he can shoot really far).

*Set: Power & Reality*  

When you spend a power symbol from a Location in your resource row to put Hawkeye into a **Nest**, put the Location card partly underneath him and leave it face up as the **Nest**. (If you pay for the power by discarding a Location or you reduce the cost of the power to zero power symbols, nothing happens.)

While Hawkeye's **Nest** is one of the Locations named on his card, he has the associated text. 

While a Location is a **Nest**, it still counts as a Location as as being a face-up resource in your resource row, however it can't be used to generate a power symbol anymore. If the Location gets KO'd or leaves your side, the **Nest** effect ends. If the Location gets turned face down by an effect, put it back into your resource row and the **Nest** effect ends.

When Hawkeye gets stunned or leaves your side, turn the Location face down and put it into your resource row and the **Nest** effect ends.

If Hawkeye uses **I Want You On That Roof** while he already has a **Nest**, turn the old **Nest** faced own and put it into your resource row and this **Nest**effect ends.

Q: Scenario: Hela is in combat with another multiple-health SC who has no wounds. She gets into a "mutual stun" in combat with that SC. Will the Hela's "Goddess of Death" power still be activated to KO the SC on the enemy side?

A: While Hela is face down this power is turned off. If Hela is involved in a mutual stun, her power does NOT apply any longer. So the other character's Base Health will revert back to what it normally is before you check to see if it has enough wounds to become KO'd.

Q: If I use **Sow Distrust** on my opponent and she has her MC removed from game (such as with Singularity), can I pick any card I want?

A: The effect is asking if a character in their hand matches the team affiliation of their MC. If the opponent does not have an MC at the time the effect resolves, then any character the player chooses, "will not share a team affiliation with that players main character." As he does not have one. Short of it, you can discard any character you like.

A: The design intent for Hybrid was that you have to have four, physical cards with those names in your KO pile. Hybrid can certainly count as any of those names due to AKA, but he’s only one physical card.

Because of this unfortunate oversight, we need to tweak his wording just a little bit to support this idea:

> “During your Build Phase, if you have four supporting characters in your KO pile with the names ‘Agony’, ‘Lasher’, ‘Phage’, and ‘Riot’, you may put Hybrid from your hand onto your side.”

So if you had, for example, two Hybrids, one Lasher, and one Agony in your KO pile; you could put a Hybrid from your hand onto your side.

**Fluid Tactics** lets you convert ATK from a **Combat** Plot Twist into DEF (or vice versa). For example, if you play a Plot Twist that gives him +3 ATK, you could have him gain +3 DEF instead. It has to be all or nothing. You can't play a Plot Twist that gives him +3 ATK and convert it into +2 ATK and +1 DEF.

Note: +1/+1 counters granted from Plot Twists can't be converted by **Fluid Tactics**.

The In-Betweener couldn't decide exactly how much cost, ATK, DEF, and health to have so he ended up between two whole numbers. In most cases, his stats work like this. 1 ½ cost means you must pay 1 ½ recruit points to recruit him. So you will have ½ a recruit point left over. 4 ½ ATK means his strikes will stun a 4 DEF character but not a 5 DEF character. 3 ½ DEF means if he is struck with 3 ATK, he won't get stunned, but if he gets struck with 4 ATK he will get stunned. 2 ½ (Health) means 2 wounds won't KO him, but 3 wounds will.

While equipped, the Infinity Gauntlet allows you to turn any number of face-down Infinity Gem equipment in your resource row face up to show that you've "set" them into the Gauntlet. If a card with Infinity gets put into a KO pile from anywhere, you may shuffle it into its owner's deck. 

If the Gauntlet leaves play, leave the face-up Gems in your resource row as they are. However, you can no longer user their powers. If a character on your side equips the Gauntlet later in the game, those Gems will already be inset and its Wielder can use their power again.

**Infinite Power**  
This allows you to do anything you want for the rest of the game. Hera re some examples of things you could do:

* Put a +1/+1 counter on a character.  
* Take an extra turn.  
* Use a Build Phase power during your Main Phase.  
* Flip your deck over.  
* Institute a shared turn.  
* Win the game (unless there are any effects preventing you from winning the game).  
* Turn off any effects that are preventing you from winning the game.  
* Now win the game.  
* Draw a card.

**Create Wall of Force** puts a Wall of Force Terrain token into your back row. It's just like a normal Terrain except it's a token, which eans it starts out of play (but not in any piles such as the City or Forest Terrain piles). Wall of Force is destructible (it has 3 [Health]), which means an enemy character can attack it if the character would normally be able to attack into that row. 

For example, if you have no front row characters, an enemy character can attack your Wall of Force. Or an enemy character with ![](%%Flight%%) (Flight) could fly over your front row to attack your Wall of Force. 

When a character attacks a destructible Terrain, immediately wound the terrain and the combat is over. (There is no opportunity to play plot twists or use super powers, etc.) Once the Wall of Force has 3 wounds, remove it from the game.

A **Battle of Wills** requires characters to bid how many power symbols they'll pay to take control of the Iso-Sphere. It works like this:

The equipped character starts the bidding. (They can bid 0.) Then the next player either chooses a face-up character on their side to bid a higher number or passes. If they pass, they're out of the **Battle of Wills**. Then the next player goes, and so on until all but one player passes. Then that player's character pays the winning number of power symbols from their resource row (no discarding from hand) and the Iso-Sphere is moved to that character (if it's not already there). 

**Note:** A character can't bid a number they can't pay. once you choose a character as a bidder, you can't choose a different character to be your bidder in the same **Battle of Wills**.

*Set: The Omegas*

Q: Take this scenario: Jean Grey Omega MC Level 2. Owner has Dagger (HAMMER) on the board. Jean attacks, initiating her "Out of Control" power. Can Dagger convert those counters to +1 counters and still give Jean an XP?

A: Yes.

Replacement powers modify the things it says it replaces. In this case, Dagger changes the -1/-1 to +1/+1.

Straight from the compiled rules:

> Replacement Modifiers Replacement modifiers will change an existing modifier or event in order to produce a different result. This does NOT change the source of the original modifier or event, it just changes how it behaves. If two replacement modifiers are trying to change the same modifier or event, then the controller of the character being affected by the original modifier or event chooses the order. In some cases, once the first replacement modifier applies, the second one is no longer relevant. Replacement modifiers will usually begin with "If" and always contain the word, "instead."

Note the second sentence.

This does NOT change the source of the original modifier or event, it just changes how it behaves.

If Jenn is in your deck, you start the game with a **Wish** pile. When you make your deck, choose three different cards and put two copies of each of them into your **Wish** pile. There are a few rules (besides no wishing for more wishes):

- You can't choose Tokens.
- You can't choose Main Characters or Locations.
- You can't choose cards that start the game in piles (like Agendas) or cards that require a pile of their own.
- You **can** choose cards that couldn't start in your deck, like Illustrated Universe cards and other teams' Loyalty cards.
- You **can** choose copies of cards that are already in your deck, even if your deck already has the maximum number of those cards. 

During setup put your **Wish** pile out of play face down. Your Wish pile is private. (Your opponents can't look at it but you can look at it any time.)

When you make a Wish, remove both copies of any card in your Wish pile from the game, and choose an enemy player. **While those cards are removed this way, you may play one and that player may play one.**

If the cards are Equipment or Plot Twists both of you may ignore any team affiliation play restrictions on them. If a card would be put into a KO pile, it goes into its owner's (your) KO pile.

Juggernaut is so big and powerful it’s almost impossible to beat him physically. Fortunately (for his enemies) he’s vulnerable to other kinds of attacks.

## [Juggernaut](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-096.jpg) (SC - Supervillains)
^CardNumber: ^MNB-096

*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*

Q: How does his **Unstoppable** power work?

A: You make a solo attack with him against a front row character, then during combat you activate his power. If he stuns the defender and survives the combat, you may then immediately make another solo attack with him against a back row character controlled by the same player. Leave Juggernaut exhausted and dive right into his second combat. You can attack a back row character this way even if there are still face up front row characters.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

---

Q: If I use Enchantress' **Go Forth My Champion** on Juggernaut, and then activate **Unstoppable** on his first attack on a front row character, does he exhaust for his second **Unstoppable** attack?

A: In the case of Juggernaut it says to immediately attack a back row character, so the game jumps right back into combat. When "blah" is attacked/attacks triggers will still happen, but the normal rules for checking the legality if the attack (exhausting the attacker, making sure they are not protected etc.) do not apply. So in the case of Juggernaut + Enchantress it would work like this:  
  
* Use Enchantress's power on Juggernaut.  
* Juggernaut attacks a front row character and immediately readies.  
* Juggernaut uses his Unstoppable super power.  
* Juggernaut stuns the front row character and survives.  
* Juggernaut immediately attacks a back row character without exhausting.  
* Assuming Juggernaut survives the second combat he will still be ready.

Q: I attack with my Unstoppable Juggernaut. My opponent's front row character Plays Dead. Do I still get to trample through or no?

A: If you use Play Dead on a defender, the combat is over. Since Juggernaut did not stun the defender, his ability will not trigger.

^(Source: Rule Insert)

## Kang (Frightful Foes - MC)
^CardNumber: ^FFO-005

*Set: Frightful Foes*

Your Kang Collective pile is **fixed**: it always includes Rama-Tut, Scarlet Centurion, Immortus, and Iron Lad. And it's **public**: each other player can look at it. Here's how it works:

During your Build Phase while you have exactly 3 resources, 6 resources, 9 resources, and 12 resources, you may put a random card from your Kang Collective onto your side. You may only do this once per game at each of those resource amounts.

For example, when you reach 3 resources you can put one random Kang Collective character onto your side. And then you can do it again at 6 resources, again at 9 resources, and finally at 12 resources.

The cards in your Kang Collective are main characters. Your opponents need to KO all the main characters on your side for you to be defeated. However, they don't need to KO any cards that are still in your Kang Collective pile.

For example, let's say it's turn 8 and you have Kang, Immortus, and Iron Lad on your side. Rama-Tut and Scarlet Centurion are still in your Kang Collective pile. If Kang, Immortus, and Iron Lad all get KO', you are defeated.

^CardNumber: ^FRI-009

*Set: The Frightful*

If any number of Kangs are in your deck, **The Tomorrow War** lets you pick a single **Future Date** before players draw their opening hands during setup. A **Future Date** is represented by a whole number from 1-10. It counts as being that "Date" while you have exactly that many resources.

So if you pick 7 as your **Future Date**, Kang can only appear while you have exactly seven resources. (On the bright side, he's free.) Note: If you forget to pick a **Future Date** at the beginning of the game, the game acts as though you chose 10 as the Date. 

**Time Will Tell** sets Kang's base ATK/DEF to be equal to the **Future Date** you selected. It doesn't matter how many resources you currently have. **Time Will Tell** "locks in" when you select the **Future Date** before the game starts.

Q: What if I use Singularity  to remove Kate Pryde from the battlefield. Does she still get XP from **Past**?

A: If multiple triggers occur at the same time, the turn player decides the order in which they resolve.
Powers only affect characters in play, and Level up powers are not an exception.

So, with Singularity, if you activated her power: both **Pocket Dimension** and **Past** activate at end of turn, and the active player decides in which order to resolve them.

If you resolve **Pocket Dimension** first, then Kate cannot gain the XP from **Past**, because she is not in play when it resolves.

Q: What if I use **Invisibility** to **Hide** Kate Pryde. Does she still get XP from **Past**?

A: In order for **Past** (her level up power) to trigger, Kate Pryde must be face-up and in play.

However the keyword **Invisibility** states:
> At the end of your turn, if this character is ready, you may hide it.

It is an End of Turn trigger like **Past**, so **Past** and **Invisibility** would both trigger at the same time. Even if **Invisibility** resolves first and hides Kate Pryde, the level up power **Past** has already triggered and will continue to resolve.

^CardNumber: ^MCU4-015

*Set: MCU Power and Reality*  

Q:

I've literally pored over Facebook for over an hour to try and address this, but only found a piece of it. Can we get a definitive ruling on how MCU Killmonger Supporting Character works in various scenarios? Here is the only definitive ruling I've found from a (UDE/SAG source (Chad Daniel))[https://www.facebook.com/groups/860168987351982/posts/2486465308055667/?comment_id=2486884324680432]

> As it is written, it is one power, not two seperate powers. You will only get the printed powers of the MC you choose when KMs power triggers. And it is locked in at that time. So if the MC is face down when you play KM, you get nothing. If the MC is face up when KM is played, but is kater Face down or RFGed, KM still has the powers.

So, some follow up questions that this doesn't address:

- Per the above, Killmonger (KM) only gets powers that are active at the time he appears. However, if the MC is face-down when KM appears, does that MC regain its powers when it turns face up?

  - Or, if the MC is face-up when KM appears but is turned face-down afterward. When it recovers, does it re-gain powers at that point? (KM's power says the MC loses powers, but it doesn't say that it can't gain them.)

- The rulebook notes that powers are lost when turning face-down, but doesn't specifically indicate whether they count as being "gained" when recovered.

- What about powers that remain active for face-down characters (such as Swarm and Symbiosis). Does KM turn those off and gain them from face-down MCs?

- What happens when KM appears when an MC is face-up and L1 but subsequently levels up? Does the MC re-gain all powers on its L2 card? Only new powers that it didn't lose as L1?

A: 
We believe most of this has been asked and answered on our official rules channel of the discord. Below is the entry.

> “What happens when Killmonger is recruited, but the opponent's Main is face-down at that moment? You will only gain the printed powers of the Main Character you choose at the time I Want the Throne triggers. If the Main Character is face down when you play Killmonger, you will gain nothing because that characters powers are lost while stunned. If the Main Character is face up when Killmonger is played and then becomes face-down or removed from game, Killmonger retains those powers since he gained them at the time of his appearance.”

- To point 1, since the MC didn’t lose any powers when Killmonger appeared, it will have its powers once it turns face up.

- To point 2, a character that has lost powers does not regain them by turning face down and then face up again. Turning face down “turns off” any powers the character has. And then turning face up again “turns back on” those powers. But in the example the main character has lost those powers so they are not there to “turn back on.”

- Point 3 mentions two different cases:
	- If a MC has a power that “remains on while a character is stunned”, then it will be “active” when Killmonger appears, so Killmonger will gain it and cause that character to lose it. (“Remains on while the character is stunned” doesn’t prevent other effects from causing the character to lose the power.)

	- If a MC has a power that “can’t be turned off”, then that power can’t be lost due to Killmonger’s effect. HOWEVER, Killmonger will still gain the power. In other words, Killmonger’s effect does not require the MC to lose a power in order for Killmonger to gain it. (It would have needed to say something like “Killmonger gains each power lost this way.)
	
	For example, if the MC has Swarm, Killmonger will gain Swarm even though the MC will not lose Swarm.

- To point 4, a leveled up character is not a new character so it will not regain any powers it has lost, but any new powers it has will work normally.

# Kimiko (Main Character)
^CardNumber: ^BOY-007, ^BOY-008

*Set: The Boys*   

**The Female** lets Kimiko strike an additional time during combat. She can either strike the same nemy character twice (effectively doubling her ATK) or she can strike two different enemies in the combat.

^(Source: Rule insert)

---

**More Deadlier Than the Male** starts a new combat where Kimiko is the attacker and the former attacker(s) are the defender(s). It is automatically a melee combat, and it doesn't matter what rows Kimiko and the enemy characters are in or if Kimiko could legally attack those characters. When the combat resolves, Kimiko strikes one of the defenders just like in a normal combat. However, if she used **The Female** she could strike an additional defender.

# The Kingpin
## [The Kingpin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-029.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: ^DEF-028, ^DEF-029, ^LEG-046, ^LEG-047

*Set: Defenders*

Q: When I discard a Location card to use a Super Power does that give Kingpin an XP?

A: No, "appears" means to come into play from anywhere, so the Location has to be put into play. So playing one from your hand into your resource row or putting one into play from the top of your deck with Nick Fury would count. Discarding does not.

^(Source: FB Post - Kirk)

## [The Kingpin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-047.jpg) (SC)
^CardNumber: ^DEF-047

*Set: The Defenders*  

**Underworld Boss**  
The Kingpin Supporting Character has a Super Power where he takes over as your main character. When this happens, your former Main Character becomes a Supporting Character and remains in the game. It can still gain XP and Level Up, but you don’t lose the game if it gets KO’d. Instead, you now lose the game when Kingpin gets KO’d.

Q: If Kingpin (SC) becomes my Main Character will Groot (my former MC) still be able to level down? And if so will he sill get XP later on?

A: Groot retains his powers and Level Up ability, and **We Are Groot** is a Super Power that puts him back to Level 1, so yes.

^(Source: FB Post - Kirk)

Q: I control lvl2 Professor X and 2 Underworld supporting characters. I (until end of turn) gain control of your Kingpin SC. I activate Kingpin's super power and he becomes my main character. I end my turn and return control of your Kingpin SC (my MC). You could hypothetically KO my entire board and be unable to KO my main character. What rules are there dealing with this?

A: You lose the game. More specifically, at the beginning of your next turn if your opponent controls your MC, you lose the game.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

Q: Can I steal an opponent's Kingpin with Purple Man after they've used **Underworld Boss** to make him their MC?

A: If Kingpin uses **Underworld Boss** and becomes the MC, he is no longer an SC and effects that require an SC can not be used or played on Kingpin. In short Purple Man can NOT steal Kingpin once he becomes a MC.

Q: If I activate **Underworld Boss** while Elektra is in my hand, what happens to Elektra?

A: She is demoted to a Supporting character no matter what zone she is in. From the rules: "Some effects may promote a Supporting Character to Main Character and vice versa. Unlike most modifiers, these modifiers can apply to a Main Character in any zone (or side) and continue to apply to the character even if it changes zones."

# [Kraven the Hunter](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SYN-002.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: ^SYN-002

*Set: Sinister Syndicate*  

**Spring the Trap**  
Kraven has a Reaction super power. These types of super powers work a little differently than normal super powers. Reaction powers trigger when a certain condition is met (in Kraven’s case, it’s “when an enemy supporting character appears”). When that happens you can pay a ![](%%Skill%%) (Skill), and if you do, you put three -1/-1 counters on that character. You can use a Reaction super power at any time, as long as its trigger condition is met. However, like other super powers, you can only use it once per turn.

# [Kristoff Vernard](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-047.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FAN-047

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

**Becoming Doom**  
Q: If I have a Doombot on my side, can I use Kristoff to power up Doctor Doom?

A: No. Kristoff's power is not active when he his in your hand. Therefore he doesn't have "AKA Doctor Doom" until his is in the Play zone.

# Lady Deathstrike

## Lady Deathstrike (Pro-Registration)
^CardNumber: ^THU-011

*Set: Thunderbolts*

Her **Adamantium Nails** ignore all effects increasing the DEF of the enemy characters in melee combat with her, even +1/+1 counters, and even effects that would resolve after the combat starts, like Plot Twists.

## [Lady Deathstrike (Femme Fatales)](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/aff-046.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^AFF-046

*Set: A-Force*

Q: When does Death Strike determine if Lady Deathstrike has survived the Combat if I bring her into combat with an MC with Dramatic Entrance? If she isn't stunned by the Attacking MC and activated Death Strike will the MC get 2 wounds even though Dramatic Entrance will KO her at the end of combat?

A: To survive combat means to be unstunned at the conclusion of combat resolution; The survival check/combat resolution is distinctly before end of combat effects triggering. So yes, the MC will get 2 wounds.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

---

Q: How does Lady's Deathstrike's Death Strike ability interact with Luke Cage's Impervious skin? would he negate both wounds?

A: Impervious Skin would not apply because it only prevents wounds from getting stunned, it does NOT prevent wounds given another way. The wound given by Lady Deathstrike's Super Power is NOT from stunning, it is given directly by the resolving effect.

# [Legacy](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HER-012.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^HER-012

*Set: The Herald*  

Legacy can pay for **Nega-Bands** by spending either a ![](%%Might%%) (Might) or Negative Zone Location. Spending a Negative Zone means turning a Location named Negative Zone face down in your resource row or discarding one from your hand. (It works just like using a regular Location to pay for a super power except you don't actually generate a power symbol.)

	- **Bend Reality to My Will** You pay 1 less to play cards, and enemy players pay 1 more.
	- **The Real Me** (At the end of your turn, randomly choose "The Legion" or "David Haller". Whichever you choose takes over at your next Build Phase instead of a random Personality taking over.)
- Option 6: #67 Sally: 19/2
	- **Size Manipulation** (Sally can't be struck.)
- Option 7: #115 Lucas: 12/8
	- **Sound Check** (When Lucas attacks a character, stun it.)

	- **Grab**(While this character is in the front row, enemy characters can't fly over it.
- Option 9: #186 Johnny Gomorrah: 8/8
	- **Pass the Salt** (Once on your turn, remove an enemy equipment or supporting character from the game.) 
- Option 10: #227 Time-Sink: 5/5
	- **Time Manipulation** (At the end of your turn, take another turn.)
- Option 11: #302 Unknown: 13/13
	- **Supersonic Punches** (In melee combat, this character strikes an additional two times and before other characters.)
- Option 12: #666 Styx: 6/6
	- **Death Touch** (At the start of each enemy Main Phase, choose an enemy character on that side. It strikes another character of your choice in its row.)
- Option 13: #762 Pirate: 15/15
	- **Booty and Plunder** (When an enemy player draws cards, you draw that many cards.)
- Option 14: #898 Centaur: 10/10
	- **Kick** (When an enemy character enters melee combat with the Centaur, put two -1/-1 counters on it.)
- Option 15: #1012 Delphic: 0/25
	- **Seer** (You can look through your deck at any time. Don't shuffle it afterwards.)
- Option 16: #??? The Cowboy: 25/15
	- ![](%%Range%%)
- Option 17: #??? Kirbax the Kraklar: 20/20
	- ![](%%Flight%%)
- Option 18: #??? The Fiend: 16/16
	- **Dominant Personality** (When the Fiend takes over, choose two of the above Personalities randomly. They can't take over a character named Legion on your side this game.)
- Option 19:
	- Your choice of one of the above Personalities.
- Option 20:
	- Choose twice more randomly, ignoring this result, until you have two different Personalities. They take over together (add their names, stats, and powers).

Q: Scenario: I play Legion and a Personality takes over. My opponent then Nullifies  **Spontaneous Mutation**. What happens to Legion? Does he remain "stuck" as the personality that took over until his power returns? Or does he revert to his base card? (I think he's stuck as the personality, but not 100% sure).

A:  He remains "stuck" with his current personality.

Nullifying Spontaneous Mutation takes away him changing from one Personality to another, but it doesn't get rid of the current Personality he has.

A: When multiple triggers happen at the same time, the active player chooses which happens first. If it's the Lilith player's turn they may choose to remove the KO'd character from the game first (and gain a Health). As soon as these characters change zones, any other modifiers are lost. If it's the Mantis or Immortal player's turn, they can choose their triggers to happen first and the Lilith modifier is lost and they are not removed from the game (also Lilith does not gain a Health).

*Set: Futures Past*

Here's how his **Canadian Resistance Colonel** works:

 - You can recruit characters from the three mutant teams face down (without revealing them), and if you do, they appear hidden (face down and ready) on your side, instead of face up.
 - While you still must pay normally for cards recruited this way (including any additional costs), you do not have to announce the recruit cost of the hidden cards you are recruiting.
 - For example, if you have 7 recruit points and you recruit a 3-cost and 4-cost character face down, you don't have to announce how much you paid for each one or how much you paid total. (However, you can't spend more recruit points than you have.)
    * You must also follow any other rules about recruiting, including any restrictions for when a character can appear, including uniqueness rules.
 - Hidden cards recruited this way mostly act like other hidden cards:
    * They aren't stunned, can't have Equipment or +1/+1 or -1/-1 counters, can't be attacked, and lose their powers.
    * They keep their names and team affiliations.
    * During your Recovery Phase, you must turn hidden cards on your side face up when you recover your stunned characters.
 - There are exceptions to cards recruited this way when compared to normal hidden cards.
	 * Only the cards' owner can look at them.
	 * They can make attacks while hidden on the turn appear:
		 * Cards with printed ![](%%Flight%%) and ![](%%Range%%) can make attacks while hidden as if they still had those powers.
		 * Remember, these cards keep their team affiliations, so they can make team attacks as normal, even with face-up characters.
		 * They don't exhaust when they attack.
		 * Right before they strike, turn them face up and exhaust them.

**Note:** Opponents will need to verify after cards recruited this way are turned face up that they were played within the rules, especially in regard to their costs.

A: If the attacker does not have ![](%%Flight%%) (Flight) and was making a melee attack and Luke becomes the new defender in the combat (assuming he was not previously in the combat), then it would meet the requirements of Luke entering melee combat with at least one character without ![](%%Flight%%) (Flight). Luke would gain 1 XP.

^CardNumber: ^MNB-018

*Set: The Marvel Battles*

Q: When I use his **Impervious Skin** power, what happens if he gets stunned?

A: Everything happens normally – he turns face down, loses all +1/+1 or -1/-1 counters, etc. – the only difference is he won’t gain a wound.

Q: Cable attacks Luke and both use their powers (**Ultimate Soldier** and **Impervious Skin**) - no other effects are played. Has Luke's power worn off by the time Cable's power stuns him?

A: Cable's power triggers at the end of combat, so Luke Cages' power has already expired by the time Cable's power has resolved. So yes, Luke gets a wound.

^CardNumber: ^ALN-023

*Set: The Alien Battles*

Q: Are equipment powers separate from character powers. Ex. Does Cosmo shut off the equipment on the character?

A: This has been changed as of the [August 2021 Rules update](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2021/08/vs-system-2pcg-rules-update-august-2021/). Powers are no longer assigned to the character the equipment is attached to (with some exceptions). See also [this article for a full explanation](https://www.thebuildphasenetwork.com/articleblog/digesting-2021-equip-rules).

---

Q: Does activating the **M-40 Grenade** give Storm MC an XP?

A: "The Equipment gives the character new powers and will stay with it until that character gets stunned or leaves play."    
So the character has the power and the character is using it, so yes, this would count for Storm.

Q: If I want to use a wild location to pay for the Super Power granted by Equipment, which one do I need to use?

A: Since the equipped character pays for the power, any wild location will need to match the equipped character's team affiliation.

Q: Does using the **M-40 Grenade** ability count as that character causing the stun (if it stuns?)

A: The equipped character gets credit if an equipment power stuns a character. If the -3/-3 stuns a character they would get credit. Also if they are looking for credit KOing a character and the -3/-3 KOs them, they get credit for the KO.

The Mad Thinker's **Computer Mind** is so powerful he can very accurately predict what his enemies are going to do. When you make a **Prediction**, secretly write down the name of two characters; an attacker and a defender. The names don't have to be characters in play at the time Mad Thinker uses the super power. When a character with the attacker's name attacks a character on your side with the defender's name (even in a team attack), cancel the combat. Then make another **Prediction** about the same turn, but this time you'll have a lot more data! You can make a maximum of two **Predictions** from each use of the super power.

^CardNumber: ^FFO-010, ^FFO-011

*Set: Frightful Foes*

If you're playing as the Maker, you'll bring a normal Invention Pile. (It can include Frightful Inventions, even if no characters in your deck can create them.)

Then on the first turn of the game, **Anything is Possible** will shuffle the Inventions in your pile into your deck. **Anything is Possible** also allows you to play an Invention with a team affiliation even if you don't have a a face-up character with that affiliation. This effect starts with "This game" which means it lasts whe whole game even if the Maker is face-down or has lost his powers somehow.

**Note:** If somehow you have cards in your Invention pile that don't say Invention on them (such as if the Maker supporting character is in  your deck), those cards will NOT be shuffled into your deck by **Anything is Possible**.

## [The Maker](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FRI-015.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FRI-015

*Set: The Frightful*

If the Maker is in your deck, you get to have the usual Invention pile, plus you can add up to five Equipment to it. They must be different cards (same name but different game text is fine) and can’t already have the Keyword  **Invention**. (You can also include copies of those Equipment in your deck if you like, and the copies in your Invention pile don’t count against them. For example, you can have a  **One of a Kind** Equipment in your deck and the same one in your Invention pile.)

**Note**: While the Maker (and only the Maker) can Invent those Equipment, you can still only play them if you meet their play requirements. For example, if the Maker invents a (Hydra) Cosmic Cube, you get to put it into your hand. But you still can’t play it unless you have a character with the Hydra team affiliation on your side.

He can also split up his strikes if he's in combat with multiple enemies (such as if he's being team attacked).

**Black Mist**'s phrase "could melee attack" menas Malakai Black must be able to attack the enemy (for example, Malakai Black must be in the front row, can't be exhausted, and the enemy character can't be protected).

Mandarin is really three potential characters in one. If Mandarin is in your deck you’ll need to bring your **Behind the Camera** pile with you which includes two copies of **Trevor Slattery** and one copy of **The Ten Rings**. When Mandarin gets KO’d, you’ll remove him from the game, shuffle your Behind the Camera pile, and randomly put one of the three cards there into your hand. 

This represents who Mandarin really is – lowly actor or deadly warlord. Leave the Behind the Camera pile face down – it’s important that your opponent doesn’t find out who the Mandarin really is until you’re ready to show them.

When Mastermind appears, you'll create a Tactics pile made of any number of other Masterminds you have in your deck and hand. (Note: You don't have to put every Mastermind from your hand and/or deck into your Tactics pile.) Tactics piles are public. When Mastermind gets attacked, you may choose to play a random card from your Tactics pile. If you do, follow the instructions under its Tactic. Then put the card into your KO pile. When Mastermind leaves play, you'll leave your Tactics pile where it is. A player can only have one Tactics pile at a time. Later, if Mastermind appears on your side again, and you can (and want to) add more Tactics from your hand or deck, add them to your existing Tactics pile. Note: One of Mastermind's Tactics sets an attacker's ATK to 0 this combat. That character can still gain ATK later in the combat.

*Set: The Utopia Battles*

Q: If Match strikes a Defender does he *only* put -1 counters on someone, or does he do counters *and* strike simultaneously?

A: When he strikes a Defender, his strike *is* the -1/-1 counters. These are applied during combat resolution. So, let's say that his opponent is 4/4 and is in position to strike back. Both Match and the Defender would strike simultaneously. The Defender hits with 4/4, Match hits with his counters (which haven't yet resolved). Match would be stunned by the strike back, and then the Defender would be reduced to 0/0 with the counters and would also be stunned.

Q: Match's ability says, "If Match would strike a defender, put -1/-1 counters equal to his ATK on that defender instead." Does that mean this ability only applies when Match is attacking? (Not when he is striking back as a defender.)

*Set: Webheads*  

If Mattie is in your deck you can bring a Gift pile, which must include one of each of the five Gifts: Death, Immortality, Knowledge, Madness, and Power. When Mattie uses **The Gathering of Five** choose five different characters on  your side with different names. At least one of these characters must be one of your Main Characters. Then randomly assign one of the five Gifts to each of them. If you don't have at least five characters on your side with different names (or you don't have a Main Character on your side), Mattie can't use **The Gathering of Five**.

The Gift of Death will instantly KO its assigned character. The other four grant new abilities to their assigned characters (some good, some bad). Gift cards are not actually in play. Their cards are just play aids to remind everyone what new abilities each character has gained. If a character leaves play its Gift will no longer affect them (even if that character reenters play).

Q: Can a defending character locked down by Medusa be replaced in the combat & moved with Uncanny Defense or Spiderman MC?

*Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.*  

[This card has received significant errata.](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rulings#wiki_mimic)

---

Previously the Absorption History pile included any three main characters with different names. Going forward, his Absorption History pile may only include the original five X-Men plus Professor X. This change reduces the number of main characters Mimic can copy, which avoids overpowered interactions. It also brings Mimic more in line with his classic flavor. This change is effective October 1st, 2020.

Below are the updated rules. (This replaces the rules entry in the H.A.M.M.E.R. Issue rules insert.) The changes are underlined.

---

**Mimic**

Mimic’s Absorption History, from his **Checkered Past** Keyword,  represents three characters that he’s copied powers from. In game terms it’s a pile that includes exactly three Main Character cards, one Level 1, one Level 2, and one Level 3. They can only be from the Illustrated Universe,  they must be Marvel and they must have three different card titles from the following list:

-   Angel
-   Beast
-   Cyclops
-   Iceman
-   Jean Grey
-   Professor X

Note: There is no main character with the card title Beast. Yet.

“Card title” refers to the name at the top of the card. It does not include additional names granted via  **AKA**.

At the time of this writing (September 2020), your choices at each level are:

Level 1: Angel, Cyclops (2 options), Iceman, Jean Grey, Professor X (2 options)

Level 2: Cyclops (2 options), Iceman, Jean Grey, Professor X (2 options)

Level 3: Jean Grey, Professor X

**Note:** While Mimic  _can_  copy Professor X’s Level 3  **Graduation**  super power, he won’t actually be able to  **Graduate**  any X-Men. (This is because the Graduation super power requires a Graduation pile, and you only get to bring a Graduation pile if Professor X is your main character, not if Professor X’s power is being copied. Look for an upcoming rules update that clarifies how out-of-game piles work.)

During setup when you reveal Mimic as your Main Character, you’ll also reveal the Level 1 character in your Absorption History. Mimic gains its Keyword and Super Powers only when the game begins.

When Mimic becomes Level 2, you’ll reveal the Level 2 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Power and loses the powers of the Level 1 character he was previously copying.

When Mimic becomes Level 3, you’ll reveal the Level 3 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Powers and loses the powers of the Level 2 character he was previously copying.

**Note:**  While  **Checkered Past** is a Keyword and can technically be turned off by certain effects, turning it off doesn’t affect Mimic’s ability to use the pile (it’s locked in from the beginning of the game).

Q: When using whichever lvl character from the **Absorption History** pile, which team affiliation does one use: Mimic's (H.A.M.M.E.R.) or the absorption power character's team?  

A: Mimic gains their powers, not team affiliations. Mimic is H.A.M.M.E.R. - it doesn't matter what his absorb guy is for any reason. That card isn't even technically in play.

*Set: New Mutants*   

Mirage’s **Create Illusion** power lets you put a basic location from your hand into your resource row. Note that the new resource won’t generate any recruit points on the turn it appears. This is because recruit points are only generated at the start of your Recruit Step, which happens before you can recruit characters like Mirage.

**Up to the Minute** requires you to check the time at the moment the power resolves, not while you're searching your deck. So let's say it's 2:30 PM when she uses the power. You'll search your deck for a Location card, even if it becomes 2:31 PM while you're in the middle of looking throug your deck.

*Set: Fractured Family*  

**Volunteer to Register** only counts actual letters, not *s, periods, hyphens, or other punctuation.

Since Mister Fantastic is on both the [Fantastic] and [Pro-Registration] teams, when he creates an **Invetion** it can be from either of those teams (or a neutral one).

**Project Neutral** creates a **Clone** of a character in your hand. Put a token copy of the chosen character onto your side. The copy has all the printed characteristics (name, team, cost, ATK/DEF, Health, powers) of that character plus it gains **Lethal**.

**I Can Predict Your Every Move** can temporarily reduce the ATK/DEF of a character while in solo combat with Mister X.For example, if a character with a printed ATK/DEF of 4/4 has three +1/+1 counters it is currently 7/7. However, while in solo combat with Mister X, itsATK/DEF counts as 4/4.

# MJF

*Set: AEW* 
 
Once MJF uses **Dynamite Diamond Ring** and/or **...And You Know It!**, its effect lasts for the rest of the game, even if an effect causes MJF to lose his powers. 

**...And You Know It!**'s effect works like this: When MJF attacks, check the defender's ATK. Then MJF gainst ATK until his ATK is 1 higher than the defender's ATK. However, if later in the combat the defender gains or loses ATK that will not change MJF's ATK. (In other words, **...And You Know It!** happens right away when MJF attacks but then doesn't do anything else during the combat.)

**Note:** If MJF's ATK is already higher than the defender's ATK, **...And You Know It!** won't do anything.

# Molecule Man (MC)
^CardNumber: ^FFO-012, ^FFO-013

*Set: Frightful Foes*

To **Animate** your deck do the following: Put your deck into your front or back row. (This counts as it "appearing.") It is now a supporting character named "Animated Building" with ATK and DEF each equal to the number of cards in it, and 1 Health.

It is **Massive**: It attacks entire rows instead of characters and strikes with its full ATK against each defender in the row. The defenders strike it with their total ATK.

It is **Monstrous**: when defending against a melee team attack it strikes with its full ATK against each attacker.

Like a normal supporting character it can be ready/exhausted; be stunned/hidden; have counters; gain and lose powers, etc. When it gets stunned/hidden turn it over. (Everyone will see your bottom card.) If you need to draw cards while your deck is turned over, you still draw from its "top", which is the card touching the table.

If your deck gets KO'd, put all of its cards in your KO pile. If an effect would cause it to leave play or be put in your resource row, KO it instead.

While it's animated, it still counts as your deck (even if somehow it gets moved to another player's side). For example, you'll draw cards from it and **Reconstitute Matter** will shuffle your KO pile into it. If your deck has no cards it ceases to exist and will no longer be **Animated** (Even if it had some +1/+1 counters). However, you can use **Reconstitute Matter** to make a new deck, and then you could **Animate** that deck.

**Note**: If your deck is already **Animated**, using **Animate Building** again won't do anything.

Mole Man can **Tunnel** beneath enemy resources. If there are any enemy Locations, he must tunnel under those first. If there are none, he can tunnel under a face-down resource. When he **Tunnels**, remove him from the game and place him beneath the card he is tunneling under. At the start of your next turn, put him back onto your side and if the card he was under was a Location, turn it face down. If it was already face down, KO it.

If he is beneath a Location and it gets turned face down (including by being used for a super power) or leaves play, put him into your back row. If he is beneath a face-down resource and it leaves play, put him into your back row.

A: Though it's not totally clear, "that" refers to the opponent against whom you were attacking. So if you had 3 face down resources and your opponent had 5, Moloid would get +5 ATK when it attacked.

*Set: The Omegas*  

**Pull On Quantum Strings** means you can have Equipment, characters, and Plot Twists (non-locations) face up in your resource row and during your Resource Step you can play a non-location face up as a resource. Characters on your side can use these non-locations to pay for their Super Power, regardless of their required power symbols. 

Example: You have Monarch and the X-men Cyclops Supporting Character on  your side. Cyclops can use any of the non-locations face up in your resource row to pay for his **Battle Tactics** Super Power. He can still use School for Gifted Youngsters and Training Grounds to pay for the Battle Tactics normally.

These non-locations can't be used for any other purpose.

**The Hunger** lets Morbius melee attack characters in his own front row. In order to do so, Morbius must be ready and in the front row, and then he will exhaust to start the combat. It works just like a normal combat, except the attacker and defender are both on the same side and don't count as being enemies to each other. During the combat, each player can play Plot Twists (perhaps to cancel the combat) then each character will strike each other. If Morbius KO's the defender and survives, his **Vampire** power will give him a vitality counter.

When Mr. Black and the defender strike each other:  
* Mr. Black can get stunned as normal.  
* A hidden character can get stunned as normal. (Wound it and change its orientation from ready to exhausted.)  
* If Mr. Black’s strike would stun an already-stunned character, wound it instead. Note: A stunned character can’t be stunned (including by having its DEF reduced to 0 or a direct “stun” effect).

Does Kamala's power avoid being touched by Even the Odds?

A: Even the Odds will remove and +1/+1 counters from \*Ms. Marvel\*, but yes she "avoids being touched" by Even the Odds' effect that resets a character to their base ATK/DEF because her power changes her base ATK/DEF.

Q: Put another way, is the intent of Even the Odds to return a card to its *printed* stats? Or is it worded with the intent that cards that change their base stats can get around the effect?

A: Yes, cards that change their Base stats get around Even the Odds' "reset" effect.

Q: Ok, what if she has three -1/-1 counters on her, giving her basically -2 Attack and she gains +4 ATK making her have 2 ATK; does she gain 4 XP or 2 XP?

A: 4 XP . From the rule book: ATK values that are below 0 are treated as 0 except when trying to raise or lower them. In the latter case, always use the real value.

^(Source: FB Post - Kirk)

A: Yes and Yes.

Q: Mystique and Green Goblin are out; Mystique attacks and uses her power to give her 4 ATK and she has enough to level up. Does she keep those 3 ATK she took from green goblin to make her a 9/7?

A: Yes. The vast majority of the time, the results of a resolving effect are "locked in" at resolution and even if the situation later changes, the modifier still applies. The only exception is if they use the word "While" which mean it is continuously looking for a specific variable to be true or false.  
  
Since this does not use "While" we know it is locked in at resolution. As long as the duration has not expired, any modifier affecting the Lvl 1 Mystique will continue to affect the Lvl 2 Mystique.  
  
In the example given by the OP, the +3 ATK gained by her Super Power would continue to apply after she is level 2.

Q: With **Masquerade**, Does Mystique gain that character’s base ATK, or their current attack including counters/modifiers/etc?

For example, if Spider Ham attacks Mystique while Madame Web is in his side, giving him 8/4, and Mystique uses masquerade, does she gain attack up to 6 (since this is spider ham’s base ATK) or does she gain attack up to 8 (since he has +2/+2 from madame web)? So would she gain 5 XP or  7 XP?

A: Mystique matches power including all modifiers, so she’d gain 7 attack. It would say “printed attack” if it worked the other way.

With **The Perfect Metamorph**, you may choose a face-down character. If the chosen character would get stunned by  **The Perfect Metamorph**  but it’s already stunned, nothing else happens. (Neither it nor Mystique get stunned.) If the chosen character is no longer in play when Mystique would be stunned, Mystique gets stunned normally.

Keep in mind, the effect from  **The Perfect Metamorph**  lasts until Mystique gets stunned. If it allows her to avoid getting stunned, the effect remains active. In other words, a single use of the power could prevent several stuns to Mystique.

Even if  **The Perfect Metamorph**  is active, Mystique can use it again to change her name and affiliations, and to have a different enemy character become her new potential stun replacement.

Note: If Mystique takes the name of a unique character with the same name as a supporting character on your side, that supporting character will get KO’d.

Q: What happens if Mystique has any +1/+1 counters when I use Impersonate?

A: Apply the +1/+1s after her stats change. For example, let’s say she has two +1/+1 counters and she Impersonate’s a 4/7 character. She’ll become 4/7 with two +1/+1 counters for an end result of 6/9.

A few things about these Plot Twists and Special Locations: 

* They are not super powers.  
* Your main characters must be face up to pay for them. (But it doesn't have to be in the combat to pay for Nova Corps.)  
* Your main characters can use a "Wild" Special Location from their team to pay for them.  
* These cards are neutral, so just like any other neutral cards they can be in Loyalty decks.  
* The Special Locations don't count as locations power symbol (for powers like Black Widow Main Character's Level Up power **Red in Her Ledger** or Zzutak's **Paint to Life**).

Editor's note: Some of the following information below can be confusing out of context of the [August 2021 Rules update](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2021/08/vs-system-2pcg-rules-update-august-2021/). Please also refer to [this Build Phase Article for further clarification](https://www.thebuildphasenetwork.com/articleblog/digesting-2021-equip-rules).

---

> The Nullifier's effect can be Nullified by effects that turn off keyword powers and if it changes sides it will target the updated "enemy characters" as the affected target(s).

This was clarified in July 2019 that many people were playing this card incorrectly. We originally believed this card to work in a way that made Nullifier's effect independent of the card itself, so it could not be Nullified. Essentially that the effect and targets would be unchanged until the card left the play zone, even if it swapped sides or got targeted by Cosmo or another Nullifier.

^(Source: UDE official clarification)


---

> The Nullifier only affect powers that resolve in the play zone.

This was clarified in July 2019 that the Nullifier will have no effects on powers that resolve before they appear such as Dark Phoenix SC who has a "When you recruit Dark Phoenix" trigger. Recruiting happens before appearing so it cannot be stopped with the Nullifier. This is also true of cards that have effects that will resolve from your hand such as Shadowcat SC's Intagible Escape. You can still name a power that is not in play yet, but Nullifier will only act upon that power once the card is in play and some effects will resolve before that point.

^(Source: UDE official clarification)

---

To explain the above differently:

First, the Nullifier does two things: A triggered power when it appears (you name a thing); then, a continuous power that keeps the named thing turned off.

Because this is now classified as a continuous modifier it means that it will impact characters played after the Nullifier entered play.

It also means that when Grid steals a Nullifier it continues to work, targeting *enemy* characters. This turns the Nullifier against the player who played it.

However, as of the [August 2021 Rules update](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2021/08/vs-system-2pcg-rules-update-august-2021/), because Equipment powers are no longer all granted to the equipped character, you can no longer target **Ultimate Nullification** with another Nullifier, Cosmo, or any other card that specifically targets powers on characters.

# [Odin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MCU6-004.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MCU6-004

*Set: Space & Time*  

Odin introduces **Level Down Powers** to the game. A Level Down Power works just like a Level Up Power, except instead of gaining XP which advances it to a higher level, it gains XP which regresses it back to a lower level. When a character gains Level Down XP, put an XP counter on its Main character card that is one level lower than its current level. If a character has both a Level Up and a Level Down Power, it's possible for it to gain and have both kinds of XP. However, once it levels up or levels down, all of both types of XP will be removed.

Here's an example of how Odin works:

Odin actually starts off as his most powerful self at Level 1. but after a few turns of gaining power through **The Odinforce** (or other means) he'll level up and then take a nap. While he's asleep he can gain both Level Down XP and Level Up XP. If he gets two Level Down XP, he'll wake up and level down back to Level 1, and both kinds of his XP will be removed. But if he gets two Level Up XP instead, he'll level up to Level 3 and realize his time has come.

This card has received errata in the [August 2021 Rules update](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2021/08/vs-system-2pcg-rules-update-august-2021/) and now reads:

> When you recruit Onslaught, each player reveals cards from the top of their deck until they reveal a character other than Onslaught. Remove those characters from the game and shuffle the remaining cards into those decks. Onslaught has the printed powers of the removed cards and base stats equal to their total printed ATK, total printed DEF, and total printed [Health].

**Joint Consciousness**  
Onslaught’s power occurs when you pay to recruit him, but before he appears. This way he will trigger any “appears” powers on cards he removed from the game.

^(Source: Rule insert)

Q: What happens when Onslaught comes back from Singularity's **Pocket Dimension**? Does he keep the ATK/DEF and Health he gained from when he was recruited?

A: If he is removed from the game and comes back, he is a 0/0 with 0 health. The Modifier created by **Joint Consciousness** can not track him between zones, so once he leaves play, it no longer applies. When he comes back into play, **Joint Consciousness** will not trigger.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel)

---

Q: What happens if I **Nullify** Onslaught with Cosmo?

A: Cosmo prevents powers from working, it does NOT stop modifiers from applying to a character. Once **Joint Consciousness** has resolved and established the base stats, using Cosmo on him will NOT change that. It will only suppress any powers he may have gained.

Q: What happens if Onslaught has a +1/+1 counter and is moved to Singularity's **Pocket Dimension**. He comes back as 1/1 with 0 Health, is he stunned?

^CardNumber: ^TUB-008, ^TUB-009

*Set: The Utopia Battles*  

**Souldagger** causes a character to lose each modifier it gained during combat. A modifier is an effect that modifies the game. There are two types of modifiers – 

A one-shot modifier does something immediately and then is done. Example: “Put two +1/+1 counters on a character.”

 A continuous modifier has an ongoing effect on the game, which may or may not have a duration. Example: “Choose a character to get +2/+0 and **Lethal** this combat.” 
 
When Pixie uses **Souldagger**, it will cause an enemy character to lose any continuous modifiers that are applying to it. (It won’t stop any one-shot modifiers because it’s impossible for there to be any one-shot modifiers happening while you use **Souldagger**.) 

**Half-Fairy** will give Pixie an XP when any character (including an enemy) pays an ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy). This includes when a character uses an ![](%%Energy%%) (Engergy) Super Power, or choosing to spend an ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy) when you play the Plot Twist **Sacred Ground**.

In this set the Professor gets a whole new main character, and this time he goes up to Level 3. (Note: This new Professor X can’t level up into the old one from The Marvel Battles set and vice versa.

Professor X’s **Graduation** power lets you turn an (X-Men) supporting character into the main character version of that character. (Once it’s become a main character it can level up normally. Professor X is a really good teacher.)

This allows you to have any number of main characters in play at once. However, Professor X is still your MAIN main character – if he gets KO’d you’ll lose the game. (Your other main characters getting KO’d won’t cause you to lose the game.)

*Set: The Omegas*  

Proteus is technically a Supporting Character but he doesn't want to actually be in play. He prefers to have a physical host. If he would be recruited, you'll remove him from the game instead and choose a face-up character on your side to be his Host. If you don't have a face-up character, Proteus will still be removed from the game. When his Host gets stunned or leaves play Proteus will no longer have a Host, but he does remain removed from the game.

If Proteus would appear any other way except by being recruited, he will be stunned and KO'd because he has zero DEF.

^(Source: Rule insert)

Scenario: An enemy character is Proteus' host. I recruit Dark Phoenix and remove Keywords from the game.

Q: Does the +10/+10 remain on the character because Proteus' **Reality Warping** has been already activated and now Proteus is no longer in the game?

A: Reality Warping is a Keyword that grants a Super Power. If Dark Phoenix calls Keywords the entire Keyword is removed including the Super Power ability. If Dark Phoenix calls Super Powers only the Super Power ability of Reality Warping is removed. (Mark from Upper Deck)

Said another way, since a keyword granted all these powers and boosts, if keyword text is removed as a concept then it is like the keyword never existed in the first place.

Q: Can I use Boomerang (for example) to remove keyword powers from Proteus's host, and thereby remove the effects from the **Reality Warping** power?

A: No. **Reality Warping** isn't granted to the host as a keyword power, per se. It is a keyword power on Proteus (who has now been removed from game). The effect granted to the host is considered a modifier, so it isn't removed by effects that remove powers. See the post about Shadow King below for a comparable ruling.

^CardNumber: ^CV3-010

*Set: Crossover Vol. 3*

Q: If I power up Punisher 2099 with multiple copies in a single attack, does each power-up add another wound?

A: Yes. Each copy of Punisher 2099 that is used to power up grants an additional wound. So if you powered him up with two copies, it would grant two additional wounds; three total - one for the attack and two for the two copies discarded to power up.

Q: How does Cosmo interact with a Purple Man that has already stolen a character in the turn it came into play?

A: Once Purple man's power has been activated and resolved, it is independent of its source. Cosmo removing his power after the fact has no effect on a modifier from a previously resolved power.

## [Pyro](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BOM-008.jpg) (SC)
^CardNumber: ^BOM-008

*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*  

Pyro’s **Fire Manipulation** power lets him create a supporting character creature that has the stats of a random character from your deck. The new character uses a physical supporting character card but erases its name, team affiliation, and game text and powers and replaces them with the name Fire Man, the (Brotherhood) team symbol, and the Creature keyword. (Which means it can’t have equipment.) When it’s KO’d or otherwise leaves play the card will go back to counting as the character printed on it.

Q: Can I use **Fire Manipulation** to pull an MC from the deck and turn it into Fire Man (Such as a Zombie Master)?

A: No - **Fire Manipulation** can be used only for Supporting Characters.

*Set: The Boys*   

**Casual Cruelty** determines how many -1/-1 counters it would take to make a supporting character have 1 DEF and then it puts all those counters on the character all at once. If there's an effect that modifies how many counters get placed (such as Butcher doubling the counters) that happens after determining the initial number of counters needed.

**Example:** A supporting character has 5 DEF. **Casual Cruelty** determines it needs 4 -1/-1 counters, then Butcher doubles those counters to 8.

Q: Is "Quicksilver" the same as Quicksilver? Or is he a mantle of Quicksilver?

You can use this Gem to turn cards in play face up. If you choose a stunned character this counts as recovering it. If you choose a hidden character, it counts as un-hiding it. If you choose a face-down location, it will turn face up. If you choose any other type of face-down resource (including an Infinity Gem), it will remain face down. (It should be revealed to each player to prove that it's not a location). 

You can also use the Gem to turn cards in play face down. If you do this to a ready character, it counts as hiding it. If you do it to an exhausted character, it counts as dazing it (i.e. stun it but it doesn't gain a wound). 

If you do it to an equipment, that equipment will stay equipped but its powers are temporarily turned off. It will turn face up again when the characters on that side would recover. If you do it to a location or face-up Infinity Gem, it will turn face down.

Q: How does Ripley #8's **Acidic Blood** interact with Dagger? 

A: The short answer is this:

 1. When you trigger her ability, you still have to choose a number of -1/-1 counters that would not reduce her DEF to 0.
 2. At this point, Dagger's ability takes effect. If you have Defenders Dagger, the -1/-1 counters are simply not added to Ripley. If you have H.A.M.M.E.R. or Anti-Registration Dagger, then those counters are replaced with +1/+1 counters on Ripley or Dagger respectively.
 3. Because the -1/-1 counters never actually hit Ripley, the "Then put that many counters on an enemy supporting character" never gets to trigger.

Q: Ok, so now I have two Rogues in play (via Madame Masque as mentioned above); if the first one with **Swarm** is Stunned does she lose **Swarm** and do I lose the second copy to uniqueness?

A: While the stunning itself would NOT remove **Swarm**, that is not relevant here. The modifier that gives Rogue **Swarm** has a duration that only lasts UNTIL she is stunned. So when she is stunned, the modifier stops giving her **Swarm**, and you will need to apply the uniqueness rule if relevant.

Q: Alright, so what if the first Rogue with **Swarm** gets Nullified by Cosmo, doesn't she lose **Absorb** which would in turn make her lose **Swarm**?

^CardNumber: ^SPF-003, ^SPF-004

*Set: Spider-Friends*  

Before he was the Scarlet Spider, the man who would become Ben Reilly was created from Peter Parker’s DNA to be a perfect clone. So in the game he actually starts off as a different “Spider” hero until his true self is revealed (once he reaches Level 2). Here’s how it works: 

Your Spider Web is a new out-of-play pile that includes up to one copy of every other Level 1 main character with “Spider” in its name. (Currently this includes Spider-Man from The Marvel Battles expansion, \* Spider-Man \* from Monsters Unleashed, and Spider-Man and Spider-Woman from this Issue.) 

Your Clone Pile is another out-of-play pile. It starts empty but during the game you’ll put characters from your Spider Web into it. 

Before the game begins, when each player reveals their main character, you’ll reveal the Scarlet Spider. Then instead of putting him on your side during setup, you’ll put a character from your Spider Web onto your side. 

When that character would become Level 2, you’ll instead transform it into Level 2 Scarlet Spider. (It will keep its counters, any effects on it, and its ready/exhausted and face-up/facedown orientation.) Then put the Level 1 main character he started the game as and the Level 1 Scarlet Spider main character into your Clone Pile. 

Once he’s Level 2, if he would be wounded, there’s a chance it was just a clone body instead: reveal a random card from your Clone Pile. If you reveal Scarlet Spider, he’ll get wounded as normal – they found you! But if you reveal someone else, he doesn’t get wounded (although whoever was revealed goes back into your Spider Web.)

Q: With Scorn, when she is flipped face down (by being stunned) does her equipment remain face-up? 

For example, if she has Iso-Sphere and she is stunned, does she still get the benefit from the Iso-Sphere when attacked by Devil Slayer? OR, similarly, is the "Battle of Wills" still in effect if she gets stunned?

A: Yes the equipment will remain face up as long as she is equipped with it. Only the character gets turned face down.

A stunned character doesn't have its own powers but it can still be affected by modifiers coming from other places including equipment it has. For example, if there were a character in play granting all other characters +1/+1, a stunned character. Usually, modifiers affecting a stunned character doesn't mean much since stunned characters don't usually do anything. But in the cases mentioned above it would matter. 

Iso-Sphere would keep granting the equipped character those stats (which would be relevant if it were attacked by Devil Slayer). Iso-Sphere will still trigger a Battle of Wits even while Scorn is stunned. 

One other thing -- a stunned character cannot use a super power on an equipment it has.

*Set: Spidey-Foes*  

**Family is a Source of Weakness** lets your (Sinister Syndicate) Main Character take a **Hostage**. If you have any Secret Hideouts in your deck, you must bring a Hostage pile, which includes one ore more *different* (Spider-Friends) Supporting Characters with the **Friends and Family** keyword.

When you play Secret Hideout, one of your Main Characters takes a **Hostage**. Choose a character from your Hostage pile and put it beneath the Secret Hideout as a **Hostage**. Your Main Character gets the Keyword Power granted by that Hostage *while that Main Character is in your front row*.

For example, if you take Mary Jane hostage, your Main Character will gain **Pounce** while it's in  your front row. (It doesn't have to be protecting anyone.)

When that Main character gets stunned or leaves play, turn the Secret Hideout face down and set the **Hostage** aside. (It doesn't go back to your Hostage pile.) Similarly, if an effect turns the Secret Hideout face down, set the **Hostage** aside. Once the **Hostage** card is no longer beneath the Secret Hideout it also stops granting its Keyword Power.

It's possible for the same Main Character to have multiple Hostages (one for each Secret Hideout you play while you have that Main Character). 

Note: A **Hostage** is never actually in play. It's either in a Hostage pile, beneath a Secret Hideout, or set aside (after leaving a Secret Hideout).

# [Shadow King](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BOM-017.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^BOM-017

*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*  

**Anchor Host**  
Shadow King is technically a supporting character but he doesn’t want to actually be in play. He prefers to have a physical host. If he would appear for any reason, you’ll remove him from the game instead and choose a face-up character on your side to be his Host. If you don’t have a face-up character, Shadow King will still be removed from the game. When his Host gets stunned or leaves play Shadow King will remain removed from the game.

Q: Can I use Boomerang (for example) to remove keyword powers from Shadow King's host, and thereby remove the effects from the **Anchor Host** power?

A: No. **Anchor Host** isn't granted to the host as a keyword power, per se. It is a keyword power on Shadow King (who has now been removed from game). The effect granted to the host is considered a modifier, so it isn't removed by effects that remove powers.

^CardNumber: ^AFF-003, ^AFF-004, ^LEG-057, ^LEG-058

*Set: A-Force*  

**Rules Lawyer**  
She-Hulk’s main character introduces a new kind of super power called a **Reaction**. It reads: 

> Reaction : When an enemy player uses a super power, you may say “Objection!” If you do, cancel that super power.

Reaction powers trigger when a certain condition is met (in this case it’s “When an enemy player uses a super power”). When that happens you can pay an (and say “Objection” of course) and if you do it cancels the super power so it never takes effect.

You can use a Reaction power at any time, as long as its trigger condition is met. However, like other super powers, you can only use it once per turn.

^(Source: Rule insert)

---

Q: How does **Rules Lawyer** work timing wise under the rules for effects needing to resolve as soon as they are played?

A: Basically when She-Hulk LV2 is in play, whenever an opponent uses a Super Power, they will need to give the She-Hulk player a chance to respond before resolving the effect.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

---

Q: How does **Rules Lawyer** work if the Super Power needs one choice made from multiple options?

A: If the effect requires a choice, like choosing a character, the She-Hulk player has to make their decision on whether or not to use **Rules Lawyer** before those choices are made.

Q: How does She-Hulk's **Rules Lawyer** work against Sister Grimm MC? I announce **Open Sesame** and flip my Academy. My opponent says objection and flips his. Do I lose my level and my ability to ever use **Open Sesame** again? And does Sister Grimm flip back to Level 1?

A: You go back to level 1 and you also cannot use that ability again.

Q: How does **Rules Lawyer** work on powers like **Nullify** or **Magnetic Supression**?

A: It doesn't, those are "Keyword Powers", **Rules Lawyer** only reacts to "Super Powers." Super Powers are powers that require an activation cost using icons from Locations.

Q: Who pays for Sif's power? Is it the MC, Sif herself, or any character?

*Set: A-Force*

Q: What happens if I use Singularity's power to remove my characters, then on my opponent's turn, Singularity is targeted by Cosmo. Do my characters still return at the end of the turn or when singularity is stunned/leaves play?

A: Singularity's power creates a delayed triggered modifier that exists independent of its source. Removing the power from the source does nothing to negate or change the delayed trigger modifier already created. In short, playing Cosmo on Singularity does not stop the previously removed characters from returning.

Q: What happens to the character brought in by Pixie if I want to RFG it with Singularity?

Q: If you Singularity Doc Oc does he draw at the start of your turn?

A: The delayed trigger from Singularity and Genius both trigger "At the start of your turn..."

So you do not draw from Genius brought back with Singularity in the same turn.

Q: Do characters return to their owners side readied and do you get to place which row when they are returned in this fashion?

Q: How does Singularity interact with Captain America SC's **Inspire** with other characters appearing, along with the Captain himself?

Q: Can a main character still gain XP when you use Singularity on them? For instance Ghost Rider can he gain XP if Singularity is attacked and KO'd?

Q: Juggernaut attacks Singularity who is in the front row, pays a ![](%%Might%%) (Might) and stuns her. Do the other characters come back in time for Juggernaut to declare his second attack or no?

A:  The controller of Singularity decides which row the characters come back into play. So they could put them in the front row, or the back row. So if they opt to put them all in the front row, it is no dice. If they put at least one in the back row, the next question then becomes, can Juggernaut attack them? And the answer is YES! You see, Singularity triggers upon her leaving play which is during combat resolution, so that is when her power triggers. Juggernaut on the other hand, triggers after combat resolution is over. Since Singularity triggered first, it will resolve first and your opponent could opt to put a character into his back row. IF he does, then it will be there for Juggernaut to attack when his trigger resolves.

Q: Singularity + Kingpin SC. I allow Kingpin to "take over", then move my original MC out with Singularity. He comes back and forgets that he is now a SC. Do I now have two MCs?

*Set: A-Force*

Q: The Singularity ruling states that when a character comes back into play it is a new character and nothing has now previously effected it. Can Sister Grimm use a **...Let the Staff of One Emerge** ability she has previously used since technically she's a new character and now has not technically used the previous ability?

A: A once per game restriction is something that functions in all zones, no matter who controls the character or what zone it is in. This means even if a character with a power with a once per game restriction leaves play and comes back, you still can not use it again if it was used before leaving play. Also if an opponent takes control of a character with a one per game restriction, if they use the super power, when you get it back, you will not be able to use that power.

**I Can and Will Fight You**
This issue introduces the powerful Alien Symbiote version of Spider-Man. But as they say, with great alien power comes great alien… danger. While the symbiote does make him stronger, he must remove it or it will quickly be game over. In the comics, when Spider-Man fights off the symbiote, it splits off from him as a separate entity. In the game, when Spider-Man sheds the symbiote, it splits off from him as a separate card. When this happens, Spider-Man will become Level 2 and now wears a cloth version of his black costume and the Alien Symbiote will look for a new host. (Note: Spider-Man Level 2 has one less Health – this represents losing the strength of the symbiote.) 

When a character with the Alien Symbiote is turned face down but isn’t KO’d, just keep the equipment token face up and ready, just like when it’s equipped to a face-up character (it doesn’t exhaust or turn face down). And remember, the symbiote is a jealous entity – it can’t be destroyed or removed from its host (at least until the host leaves play).

**Ultimate Spider-Man** lets Spidey strike multiple times in a combat. If he strikes the same character more than once, add his ATK together for each strike and then compare it to the enemy's DEF. For example, if he has 5 ATK and strikes a character three times compare a total of 15 ATK to that character's DEF. He can also split up his strikes if he's in combat with multiple enemies (such as if he's being team attacked).

*Set: Webheads*  

A British Spider-Man from another Universe, Spider-UK is a new Main Character with the **Spider-Verse** keyword. **Spider-Verse** means two things:

First, if you choose a **Spider-Verse** character to be your starting Main Character you can include up to four other **Spider-Verse** Main Characters in your deck when you build it. (Four other Spider-Verse Main Characters premiered in the 2019 Vs. System 2PCG: Crossover Vol 2 Issue.)

Second, during your Build Phase, if a character with **Spider-Verse** is in your hand, you may put it onto your side. 

Note: Spider-UK can be powered up by any character with "Spider" in their name, which includes Main Characters that are in your hand.

If they still have cards removed from **Touch Me and I'll Burn Your Eyes Out** and Starlight uses this power again, their current hand will get removed from the game separately from the cards that were removed the first time. Now at the start of their turns they will put two random cards back into their hand from EACH group of cards that Starlight removed.

*Set: Galactic Guardians*  

Kitty Pryde becomes Star-Lord when the original Star-Lord is otherwise employed. So she has *s around her name, meaning she shares the "mantle" with Star-Lord, himself. The sharing of the mantle means both characters can be on a side at the same time because they're different beings, just with the same name. So you don't KO either because of the uniqueness rules and they can't power each other up.

Note that although this card represents her joining the Guardians of the Galaxy she's still an X-Men at heart, so she has both team affiliations.

Her **Intangibility** power lets her strike characters while they're in a player's hand. This is uncanny. A couple things about this: 

* She can strike any number of 0 DEF characters (or characters with * DEF).  
* She can strike characters who normally couldn't be struck by her while on a side (like Bulletproof characters) because those powers aren't active while the character is in a hand.  
* It doesn't matter how much (Health) a struck character has, it gets discarded.

>Supreme Leader's effect will prevent you from losing the game and will also prevent other players from winning the game

Supreme Leader MC is worded in a way that may make veterans of other card games such as Magic the Gathering believe that a card like [Dutch SC](https://i.imgur.com/N3EzGfJ.jpg) or [Deadpool MC](https://i.imgur.com/3Qt4DfF.png) may still allow an alternate win condition.  After all, in MtG a player being unable to lose doesn't prevent another player from winning as they are isolated effects.  In VS 2PCG this is considered an extension of the "can't beats can" rule.  By that logic, alternate win conditions are ignored as long as Supreme Leader is preventing its controller from losing the game.

Q: What happens if I recruit Taskmaster while my opponent has Onslaught in play?

A: So Onslaught's Power happens at the time you recruit him (faster than appears powers).  
  
Taskmaster comes into play, but doesn't have Onslaught's power when he's recruited, so nothing happens.  
  
As far as the power's that Onslaught has, Taskmaster doesn't copy those because they aren't Printed Powers like Taskmaster is looking for.  
  
So Onslaught is effectively doing nothing for Taskmaster.

> Keyword abilities are only in effect while the character card is in play unless otherwise specified.

Previous to [Taskmaster's](https://i.imgur.com/85KjJHT.jpg) release, keyword abilities were active in all zones.  This allowed cards such as [Hope Summers](https://i.imgur.com/R2iOAee.png) to use their powers from the hand, deck or KO pile.  With the release of Taskmaster, this rule became limiting on design of future cards and was changed.  (For example, Taskmaster was able to be recruited from the deck with [Spider-Gwen's](https://i.imgur.com/ZkdbqZ0.png) Dimensional Watch keyword if your opponent had her in play.)

^(Source: Official clarification)

>A copied power can't copy a power with the same name as itself.

An infinite loop was discovered when [Taskmaster](https://i.imgur.com/85KjJHT.jpg) was across from an opposing Taskmaster where they would gain a copy of, then continuously copy the printed version of their opponent's Photgraphic Reflexes.  With this additional rule, this scenario would result in Taskmaster gaining two instances of all keyword powers for face-up enemy supporting characters, but the loop would not continue beyond two instances.

Q: Scenario: I have Taskmaster on my side and my opponent plays H.A.M.M.E.R. Cloak. Is Cloak hit with -1/-1 counters from Taskmaster copying **Darkforce Channeling**?

A: Yes. Powers are active before the character appears (see official rules). Taskmaster is therefore able to copy this power and when Cloak appears he gets hit with Taskmaster's copy of **Darkforce Channeling**.

At Level 1, if Thanos gets KO'd by getting stunned, **Resurrected by Death Herself** will cause him to gain an XP and become Level 2 while in the stunned position. (If a power like Hex prevents him from leveling up, he'll remain at Level 1 but still heal his wounds.)

**Schemes and Dreams**  prevents you from drawing cards during your Draw Phase, including your normal draws plus effects like Genius. However, if Thanos is face down at the start of your turn, Schemes and Dreams will be turned off. This means you can draw cards during your Draw Phase, however you can't search for a card.

**My Quest Begins** counts each card that enters your hand from your deck. So if you draw three cards, that would be 3 XP.
  
**The Universe Will Now Be Set Right**  has a 50-50 chance of removing each character on each side from the game. If this removes a players last main character, that player ;oses the game. If this removes each player's last main character (including Thanos, himself) then the Thanos player wins the game.

# Thicket
^CardNumber: ^CV4-036

*Set: Crossover Vol. 4*

Q: The Terrain card "Thicket" says that "You can't have more than one character in this row." 

So, If I place the card in a row that already has, say, 3 characters what happens?
* Does my opponent have to move 2 of the 3 immediately?
* Does my opponent have to move 2 of the 3 during the next formation step?
* Does something else happen to 2 of the 3 characters?

A: The general answer is -- If a character is ever in a row it’s not allowed to be in, the player on that side must move it to a different one of their rows immediately. If an effect is preventing that move, then the character gets KO’d.

So in the example, your opponent moves two of the three immediately. And if some effect is preventing those characters from moving

(Perhaps another player has put a Thicket in that opponent’s other row and there’s already a character there), then your opponent must choose two of those characters to be KO’d.

(Note: Tiger Shark’s strike will either stun a character in combat or put two -1/-1 counters on it, but not both.)

# Time Variance Authority
^CardNumber: ^LKI-025

*Set: Loki*

**TVA Headquarters** allows all players to play an extra resource on each of their turns as long as that extra resource is a Location with a name that isn't already on any side. For example, on the first turn of the game you could play Time Variance Authority as your regular resoruce, and then play a Fortress as your additional resource. 

On the next player's turn they could play ANY resource (including a face down card, a Fortress, or a Time Variance Authority) as their regular resource. And then they could play an extra resource as long as it's a Location that doesn't have the same name as a Location on any side.

Let's say they play an Academy as their regular resource. They can now play another Location other than Academy, Fortress, or Time Variance Authority as their extra resource. 

Now it's back to your turn. You play a Time Variance Authority as your regular resource so now there are two **TVA Headquarters** happening, which menas you can play up to two extra Locations. You play a Training Ground as your first extra Location. But the only other Locations you have in your hand are a Fortress and another Training Ground so you can't play either.

Whew! Make sense? Time travel!

During the game you can use any Ultron’s **There’s Only One Path To Peace** power to put the lowest level Ultron from your Ultron Facility onto your side. When one of your Ultron main 27 characters gets KO’d it goes back to your Ultron Facility where it will be available to be brought back again.

Q: If Valkyrie MCU MC KO's an opposing SC in combat, but is stunned herself in the process, does she get XP? (Does she go face-down before the opposing character goes to the KO pile or is it simultaneous?)

A: She does not get XP in this scenario. From the compiled rulebook:

> When a character becomes stunned, remove counters from it except wound and vitality counters, KO any equipment on it, turn it face down exhausted, and put a wound counter on it. If it now has wounds greater than or equal to its Health, or has a Lethal wound, it’s KO’d. Put it into its owner’s KO pile.

So, Valkyrie would be turned face-down and lose her level-up power before the character was put in the KO pile.

He will want to do this when he doesn't have enough ATK to stun them by striking, or when he wants to wound them but leave them face-up some someone else can finish them off.

When \*Vision\* melee team attacks and wants to use **Physical Disruption** to wound the enemy character, don't count his ATK in the total for the attack. But if the remaining attacking characters have enough ATK, the enemy character will get wounded from \*Vision\* **and** stunned by the remaining attackers.

# The Wrecking Crew
*Set: Masters of Evil*

Three **Wrecking Crew** members can each attack a different part of the game, and the Wrecker can attack any one of the three each time he attacks. (They can also make normal attacks.) Here's how it works:

These are all melee attacks so in order to make them, the **Wrecking Crew** member must be ready and in his front row, and he will exhaust to start the combat.

The **Wrecking Crew** character can attack an enemy player’s resource row/hand/deck even if that player has any face-up characters on their sides. In other words, characters can’t “protect” a resource row, hand, or deck from the **Wrecking Crew**.

While a member of the Wrecking Crew is attacking a hand, deck, or resource row, he counts as being an attacker, but there is no defending character. (The opponent still counts as the “defending player” though.) Players can play Plot Twists, use Super Powers, or Power Up as normal. For example, the defending player could play a Plot Twist to reduce the attacker’s ATK or cancel the combat.

These special attacks can be team attacks as long as each character in the attack is allowed to attack that special part of the game. For example, Piledriver and the Wrecker could team attack an enemy hand. In this case, their effects will resolve in the order the attacking player chooses. So you could have the Piledriver make the opponent discard and then draw cards, and then after that the Wrecker would do the same (or vice versa).

^CardNumber: ^FAN-014

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

**Self-Awareness**
(**Editor's note:** The original text from the rule insert has been omitted to prevent confusion. The text below is a clarified version of the power that was posted to the official compiled rulebook.)  

Characters that know they are in a Card Game play too! While a character knows they are in a card game, they have the following powers:

- When character appears, he gets his own hand and resource row until he leaves your side.
- When character moves to your side, he gets his own hand and resource row until he leaves your side.

Note: The hand counts as being part of your hand, and the resource row counts as being part of your resource row.

Here’s how it works:

- At the end of your Draw Phase, The character draws two cards into his part of your hand. (Keep these cards separate from the main part of your hand.)

    - This is the only way to add cards to his part of your hand. If another effect would add cards to your hand, they always go to the main part of your hand, never to the character’s part of your hand.
    - All other effects that affect your hand work as normal.
    - Example: If you are forced to ”discard a random card”, you must randomize all the cards in your
hand, including Wyatt’s part of your hand.
- At the end of your Resource Step, the character may play a resource from his hand into his part of your resource row. (Keep these resources separate from the main part of your resource row.)

    - This is the only way to add resources to his part of your resource row. If another effect would add resources to your resource row, they always go to the main part of your resource row, never to the character’s part of your resource row.
  
- At the end of your Recruit Step (after you’ve spent your normal Recruit Points to play cards from the main part of your hand, and any leftover Recruit Points go away), you gain 1 Recruit Point for each resource in the character’s part of the resource row. You can only spend these Recruit Points to play cards from the character’s part of your hand.
- Characters and Equipment you play from the character’s part of the hand work as normal once they are on your side. (Once they’re in play, it doesn’t matter if they came from your main hand or the character’s part of your hand.)
- You can play Plot Twists or Power Ups from the character’s part of your hand as normal.
- You can spend Locations in the character’s part of your resource row or discard them from the character’s hand to generate power symbols normally.
- When the character leaves your side , remove the cards in his part of your hand and resource row from the game. (Characters and Equipment played from his part of your hand stay in play.)

Q: What happens if Wyatt is face-down? What happens if I cancel Wyatt's power via Mutant Control Act? What about Nullifier (or Cosmo, etc.)?

A: Wyatt's power is a triggered power with a set duration. It triggers when he appears and it doesn't turn off until he is removed from play or leaves your side. Therefore, if he is face down, he still has a hand and still draws. 

If his power is negated via Mutant Control Act, it never turns on (unless he leaves play and appears again). If his power is negated after it already triggered (such as via Nullifier or Cosmo after he appeared), the power is unaffected as the modifier is now independent of the power. If the power is Nullified BEFORE he appears, however, it never triggers and he never gets a hand nor resource row.

If he is moved to a different side (such as via Serpent Crown) his hand and resource row are lost for the original player, and now the player of the side he's on gets a hand and row. (His hand and row do NOT get moved over from the original player.)

# X-23

## [X-23](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/NEW-006.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: ^NEW-006

*Set: New Mutants*  

X-23 is one of the toughest mutants around. So tough in fact that she only has a Level 1 main character. She can’t level up and she doesn’t care.

## X-23 (SC - X-Force)

^CardNumber: ^XFC-012

*Set: X-Force*  

Q: Does X-23's **Scared Stiff** superpower apply only to enemy characters in play at the time it is activated, or also all enemy characters that appear afterward (until the end of my next turn)?

A: Short answer - it applies to all enemy characters for the duration of the power (until the end of your next turn)

Long answer - See the [glossary entry about Continuous Modifiers](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary/#wiki_continuous_modifiers).

# [Xander](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-015.jpg) (SC) 
^CardNumber: ^TBB-015

*Set: The Buffy Battles*  

When Xander hides, turn him face down but in the ready orientation. Remove all +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters and Equipment from him. A hidden character doesn’t count as being stunned, but it still can’t attack or defend, it doesn’t protect anyone behind it, and loses its powers. It still keeps its other information like name and team affiliation. If a hidden character gets stunned somehow, change it to the stunned orientation (face down and exhausted). A hidden character will turn face up the same time your stunned characters would recover.

This Location is the only way to generate an Earth power symbol for a Bureau character. There are currently no basic Earth Locations in the Photographic Universe.

*Set: The New Brotherhood*  

**Disperse** is a new game action that means: First a character loses its powers, then the character gets removed from the game.

# [Yondu](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MCU6-011.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MCU6-011

*Set: Space & Time*  

In the films, these characters (Talos and Yondu) are sometimes "Good" and sometimes "Evil". In the game, you get to choose.

**Note:** They don't have any team affiliations until you recruit them. If they appear on your side some other way, they won't have a team.

^CardNumber: ^MCU4-028

*Set: Power & Reality*  

When this Plot Twist resolves, it cancels the combat. It then acts as though the player whose turn it is just said, "Okay, I'm done with my turn." And then, anything that triggers "At the end of the turn" will trigger, and the rest of the end-of-turn procedure will happen normally.

# Zombie Giant-Man
^CardNumber: ^ZOM-006

*Set: Marvel Zombies*

**Giant Zombie Man** lets Zombie Giant-Man attack entire rows instead of characters. He strikes with his full ATK against each defender in a row. And those defenders combine their ATK to strike Giant Zombie-Man.

# Zombie Luke Cage
^CardNumber: ^ZOM-009

*Set: Marvel Zombies*

**Impervious Zombie Strength** lets Zombie Luke Cage avoid enemy effects that say he can't strike AND effects on enemy characters that say they can't be struck. For example, Zombie Stilt-Man can't be struck by a character unless it has ![](%%Flight%%) or ![](%%Range%%). But **Impervious Zombie Strength** means Luke Cage can strike him anyway.
