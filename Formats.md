# Official Formats

## Basic Formats

### Multiverse Format (aka Standard Format)

This is the name for the default format of the game.  It includes all sets but still follows the [Split Universe rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/how-to-play#wiki_split_universe), disallowing Photographic Universe cards and Illustrated Universe cards to be in the same deck.

### Secret Wars Format

This is the name for the open format.  All sets are included and photographic/illustrated cards can be in the same deck.

### Loyalty Format

All cards with an affiliation in the deck (including MCs) must share an affiliation.  Non-affiliated characters cannot be included in a Loyal deck but dual affiliated characters are permitted provided one of their affiliations is shared with the rest of the deck.

---

## Featured Formats (listed most recent/future to oldest)

Any official UDE events will use the active featured format detailed below.  Take a look at the linked "relevant sets" to see the contents of the sets.  The Base set is still a recommended purchase since Basic Locations are not included in the small 55 card monthly sets and Wild Locations only appear in the set where the team was introduced.  Generic cards are allowed in all formats since the restrictions are by team.  This includes Kobik SC and Spider-Friends set's Black Cat SC as well as all the "MARVEL" affiliated cards that are in the format's universe.

### Featured Format #14: Build an Arc

Take a crack at making an Arc of your own! Select three Issues and build a deck from the cards within.

**Season:** Winter 2022

**Dates**: January 1st  2022 through March 31st  2022

**Rules:** Select one Giant-Sized 200-card Issue, and any two different 55-card Issues and build a deck from the cards within. Your deck must be either Illustrated Universe or Photographic Universe. All 200-card sets including Legacy are legal. All 55-card sets including Crossovers are legal.

You may include any Basic Locations in your deck, even if they aren’t in the Arc you’ve built.

You may include any “wild” Special Locations in your deck that share a team affiliation with your Main Character or a Supporting Character in your deck, even if those locations are not in the Arc you’ve built.

All other Special Locations must be in the Issues you have selected for your Arc.

### Featured Format #13: Second Chance

It’s always good to be retrospective. This format will allow for just that: players will be able to enjoy a more recent, yet still broad, card pool from which to build.

**Season:** Fall 2021

**Dates**: October 1st  2021 through December 31st  2021

**Rules:** You can only use cards from the last two years (Volumes 3 and 4).

You may include any Basic Locations in your deck even if they’re not in Volume 3 or 4.

You may include any “wild” Special Locations in your deck that share a team affiliation with your Main Character or a Supporting Character in your deck, even if those locations are not in Volume 3 or 4.

The standard separation of Photographic and Illustrated Universes still applies.

### It’s All Good

The Civil War Story Arc highlights two good teams at each other’s throats. This format will explore what that kind of in-fighting looks like if we expand the available combatants.

**Season:** Summer 2021
