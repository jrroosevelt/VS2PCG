# Official Formats

## Basic Formats

### Multiverse Format (aka Standard Format)

This is the name for the default format of the game.  It includes all sets but still follows the [Split Universe rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/how-to-play#wiki_split_universe), disallowing Photographic Universe cards and Illustrated Universe cards to be in the same deck.

### Secret Wars Format

This is the name for the open format.  All sets are included and photographic/illustrated cards can be in the same deck.

### Loyalty Format

All cards with an affiliation in the deck (including MCs) must share an affiliation.  Non-affiliated characters cannot be included in a Loyal deck but dual affiliated characters are permitted provided one of their affiliations is shared with the rest of the deck.

---

## Featured Formats (listed most recent/future to oldest)

Any official UDE events will use the active featured format detailed below.  Take a look at the linked "relevant sets" to see the contents of the sets.  The Base set is still a recommended purchase since Basic Locations are not included in the small 55 card monthly sets and Wild Locations only appear in the set where the team was introduced.  Generic cards are allowed in all formats since the restrictions are by team.  This includes Kobik SC and Spider-Friends set's Black Cat SC as well as all the "MARVEL" affiliated cards that are in the format's universe.

### It’s All Good

The Civil War Story Arc highlights two good teams at each other’s throats. This format will explore what that kind of in-fighting looks like if we expand the available combatants.
