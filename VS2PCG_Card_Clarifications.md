The following clarifications are included in the rule inserts that come with the various sets. 

**Note**: There have been some minor editorial liberties taken (not all are exact quotations from the main source). These changes are mainly cosmetic or made to help understand context outside of the rulesheet and do not fundamentally change the intent of the original text.

# [Abomination](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu1-033.jpg)
Set: MCU Battles  
**Give Me a Real Fight!**  
Abomination’s **Give Me a Real Fight!** Power forces a player’s first attack to include a specific character and the defender must be Abomination. However if either that character can’t attack or Abomination can’t be attacked, the effect does nothing. Also, the player can choose not to attack at all on their turn.

# [Adam Warlock](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-001.jpg) (MC)
Set: Galactic Guardians  
**Prepare for Rebirth**  
At [Level 1](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-001.jpg), if Adam Warlock gets KO'd by getting stunned, **Prepare for Rebirth** will cause him to gain an XP and become [Level 2](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-002.jpg) while in the stunned position. (If a power like Hex prevents him from leveling up, he'll remain at Level 1 but still heal his wounds.)

# [Agatha Harkness](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-013.jpg)
Set: The Fantastic Battles  
**Ancient Sorceress**  
If Agatha appearing on your side KOs an Agatha that was already on your side (due to uniqueness), **Ancient Sorceress** will count the Agatha that was KO'd.

# Agents
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra  
Several (S.H.I.E.L.D.)  characters have the new Agent Keyword Power, which allows them to work together as a spy network. When an Agent appears, look at cards from the top of your deck equal the number of **Agents** on your side. Put any of them on the bottom of your deck. The more Agents you have, the better you’ll be at gathering intel. 


# [Ajax](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-012.jpg)
Set: Deadpool & Friends  
**Pain Tolerance**  
Ajax's **Pain Tolerance** power says he can only be KO'd by fatal wounds at the end of a turn. A character has fatal wounds if it has at least as many wounds as its health. So Ajax can have any amount of wounds but won't actually get KO'd until the end of a turn.

# [Alcatraz](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HAM-019.jpg)
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**It's a Prison****It's a Prison**  
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
When the character in “prison” turns face up, the player who used Alcatraz decides which row on its original side it goes back to.

# [Alicia Masters](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-009.jpg)
Set: The Fantastic Battles  
**Neo-Realistic Sculptor**  
Here's an example of how her **Neo-Realistic Sculptor** works. The Thing is on your side, who has 10/6 ATK/DEF. While Alicia is also on your side, his ATK/DEF becomeAncient Sorceress**   10/10.

# [Armor](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-018.jpg) 
Set: The Utopia Battles  
**Psionic Exoskeleton**  
**Psionic Exoskeleton** is a combat power, but its effect lasts for the rest of the turn.

# [Angel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/RES-001.jpg) (MC)
Set: Resistance  
When Angel levels up, he transforms into [Archangel](#wiki_archangel). When this happens, he keeps his orientation (ready/exhausted, face-up/face-down), all of his counters, and any effects on him. Also note Archangel doesn’t have a Level 1 version. The only way to becomehim normally is to start the game with (Resistance) Level 1 Angel as your Main Character.

# [Angel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-001.jpg)/[Angelus](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-028.jpg) (MC) 
Set: The Buffy Battles  
Level 1 Angel and Angelus can transform between each other. However, when you build a deck you must choose either Angel or Angelus to be your starting Main Character. (You must lock in your decision at the time you build your deck, not after you see what Main Character your opponent is using.) When Angel transforms into Angelus or vice versa, he keeps his orientation (ready/exhausted, face up/face down), all of his counters (including XP), and any effects on him.

# [Angela](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-015.jpg)
Set: Galactic Guardians  
**An Angel From the Heavens**  
**An Angel From the Heavens** makes it difficult for Angela to be solo attacked. An attacker must have (Flight) or (Range) (or both) to solo attack her. 

**The Tenth Realm**  
When Angela opens a **Bridge to Heven**, you must put each revealed character onto your side. This may cause some characters to be KO'd due to the uniqueness rules.

# [Anya](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-018.jpg) 
Set: The Buffy Battles
Her **Newly Human and Strangely Literal** power ignores all stat increases including +1/+1 counters. It doesn’t remove the counters – they just have no effect this turn.

# [Archangel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/RES-002.jpg)
Set: Resistance  
**Violent**  
**Violent** means that he strikes Supporting Characters with double his ATK.

# [Ardina](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HER-008.jpg)
Set: The Herald  
**Clone of the Silver Surfer**  
**Clone of the Silver Surfer** refers to the "card title" Silver Surfer. This means the name at the very top of the card must be Silver Surfer. **AKA** s don't count.

# [Arnim Zola](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-001.jpg) (MC)
Set: Crossover  
**ESP Box**  
ESP Box takes effect once the game starts and lasts the whole game (even while Arnim Zola is stunned, after he levels up, and even after he is KO’d). You can play any Equipment as a Supporting Character, regardless of whether you have a character with a matching team affiliation. When you play one as a Supporting Character, it’s no longer an Equipment. If it has a power that references “Equipped Character,” it is its own equipped character. When the card leaves play it will go back to being an Equipment. You may still play an Equipment normally and equip it to one of your characters (including on an Equipment that you played as a Supporting Character). 

**A New Robot Body**  
When Arnim Zola enters A New Robot Body, your new Equipment-turned-Main Character will have ATK/DEF equal to its cost, 1 (Health), Swarm, and it will count as its own “Equipped Character,” just like with ESP Box. When that body gets KO’d, it can use this power again to jump into another robot body, and so on. Note: if you want to use a Wild Special Location to pay for this power, it must match the team affiliation of the Main Character using this power.

# Avalanche
## [Avalanche](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BOM-009.jpg) (Brotherhood)
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**Sustained Seismic Waves**  
Avalanche’s Sustained Seismic Waves power gets stronger each time he uses it. However, if you play a new copy of Avalanche later, the super power on that copy will start over.

## [Avalanche](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-022.jpg) (Resistance)
Set: The Utopia Battles  
**The Big One**
**The Big One** KOs basic Locations with different types. The types are:

* Energy (Blue)  
* Intellect (Yellow)  
* Might (Green)
* Skill (Red)  
* Alien (Space)
* Humanity (Earth)

# [Baron Mordo](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/LEG-048.jpg) (MC)
Set: Legacy  
**Hypnotize**  
Baron Mordo can revert a main character back to level 1 until your next turn. When the effect wears off, the character goes back to whatever level and card it was before.

# [Beast](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/DFX-010.jpg) 
Set: The New Defenders  
**Acrobatic**  
Note that **Acrobatic** doubles his DEF whether he is attacking OR defending.

# \* [Bishop](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/LEG-015.jpg) \*
Set: Legacy  
**Energy Transference**  
This power refers to (Energy/Atom) super powers.This counts for any super power with the appropriate symbol in its cost (even if it also has other symbols in
its cost).

# [Black Bolt](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MMU-037.jpg) (MC)
Set: Monsters Unleashed!  
Black Bolt’s Super Powers use the Amplify ability. When you use a Super Power, if you discard a Location (instead of turning it face-down in your resource row), you get the Amplify text. Previous Amplify Super Powers grant an effect to begin with but a larger effect if you Amplify it. Black Bolt’s powers only grant an effect if you Amplify them.

# [Black Cat](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SPF-012.jpg) (SC - unaffiliated)
Set: Spider-Friends  
**Personal Loyalty**  
Black Cat has often wavered between being a hero and a villain. In the game she doesn’t have a team affiliation and is neither Good nor Evil… until she’s on a side (she is neither Good nor Evil while she is in your hand, deck, or KO pile). Then if Spider-Man is your main character, he has a good influence on her and she’ll ferociously fight alongside her partner. But if he’s not your main character, she’ll go back to slinking around as a criminal.

# Black Panther
## [Black Panther](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/COS-001.jpg) (MC - Illustrated)
Set: Cosmic Avengers  
**Passing Down the Knowledge**  
For Black Panther's **Passing Down the Knowledge**, whenever more than one card is put into your KO pile at the same time, he still only gains 1 XP.

## [Black Panther](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu2-003.jpg) (MC - Photo)
Set: MCU Heroes  
**Vibranium Weave Suit**  
Black Panther Black Panther’s **Vibranium Weave Suit** power prevents him from being struck for the entire turn including the combat he’s currently in.

## [Black Panther](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu2-014.jpg) (SC)
Set: MCU Heroes  
**Bulletproof**  
Black Panther Black Panther’s **Bulletproof** power prevents enemy characters with [Range] from striking him. It doesn’t matter if Black Panther is attacking or defending, or if it’s a melee attack or ranged attack. As long as a character has [Range] it can’t strike him.

# Blob 
## [Blob](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-003.jpg) (MC)
Set: Crossover  
**Boing!**  
If Blob strikes a character and his **Boing!** power causes that character to strike itself, you add Blob’s ATK to that character’s own ATK to see if it’s enough to stun it. 

**Immovable Object**  
If Blob moves for any reason (including during your Formation Step or because another effect moves him), he will be prevented from gaining an XP. At the end of Blob’s first turn of the game, he will gain an XP if he didn’t move that turn.

## [Blob](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BOM-015.jpg) (SC)
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**Stuck in His Stomach**  
Blob’s Stuck in His Stomach power represents a melee attacker getting temporarily trapped by Blob’s flab. This effect will take place even if Blob gets KO’d in the attack. (Just imagine him unconscious lying on top of the attacker.)
 
**Bounced Off His Belly**  
And his Bounced Off His Belly power represents projectiles getting bounced back at any ranged attackers. Note: In the event that Blob somehow had (Range) he would not strike back using his own ATK because Bounced Off His Belly’s strike back would override his normal strike back.

# [Book of the Vishanti](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SVH-058.jpg)
See [Marvel Required](#wiki_marvel_required_.28equipment.29)

# [Boomerang](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SFO-008.jpg)
Set: Spidey-Foes  
**Specialized Boomerangs**  
Boomerang can "throw" a different Boomerang each turn at one front row and one back row enemy. You can choose a front row character on one side and a back row character on a different side. If there are no enemy front row characters you can just choose an enemy back row character (and vice versa).

# [Break the Fourth Wall](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-019.jpg)
Set: Deadpool & Friends  
This plot twist really lets you get in the game. When you put a “Me” token onto your side, you get to choose a team affiliation and your age will determine your ATK and DEF. You’ll have Leader because you’re still in charge of your team, but don’t worry – if you get KO’d you don’t lose the game because you’re also still a player. We figure you have more questions about all this, so let’s dive in. 

* **How do you prove your age?** If you’re at a tournament you’ll need an ID with a birthday. If you don’t have one, we’ll just pretend you’re 11.  

* **Does this card have different power levels for different players depending on their age?** Yes.  

* **Isn’t that ageist?** Great question. Think about it this way: Yes.  

* **What happens if I’m 29 and tomorrow’s my birthday, but then it turns to midnight in the middle of the game?** You’ll become a 3/0 and get stunned.  

* **Isn’t that kind of stupid?** Play faster next time.

* **I feel like you’re not taking this seriously.** That’s not a question.

# [Bruce Banner](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu1-003.jpg) (and the Hulk) (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
Bruce doesn’t level up. Instead, when he attacks he transforms right into the Hulk Level 2 main character. Note: Hulk doesn’t have a Level 1 version. The only way to become him is to start as Bruce.

# [Buffy](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-003.jpg) (MC) 
Set: The Buffy Battles  
**Save the World. A Lot.**  
Buffy’s **Save the World. A Lot.** power lets her Slay an Evil Main Character. If she does and it’s the last enemy Main Character in play, you win immediately! But if something goes wrong or there are other enemy Main Characters left, Buffy will get KO’d at the end of the turn.

# [Bullseye](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-027.jpg) (MC)
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**Perfect Aim**  
When Bullseye uses **Perfect Aim** it will give him ATK until it’s equal to the defender’s DEF. But if the Defender gains or loses DEF later in the combat, that won’t affect Bullseye’s ATK.

**Everything’s a Weapon**  
With **Everything’s a Weapon**, you’ll put the top card of your deck into your KO pile before you choose which enemy character to apply the effect to.

# [Cable](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/small/NEW-001.jpg) (MC)
Set: New Mutants  
**Advanced Cybernetics**  
Cable’s **Advanced Cybernetics** power gives all your equipment everywhere the (X-Men) team affiliation for a turn. This makes it so you can play any equipment even if you don’t have a character that matches the equipment’s printed team affiliation.

# \* [Captain Marvel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/COS-012.jpg) \*
Set: Cosmic Avengers  
**Cosmic Awareness**
His **Cosmic Awareness** allows him to ask an opponent one concrete question about their hand. The answer has to be truthful. In a casual setting, use the honor system, or a bystander to help out. In a more formal setting, you can ask a judge. Good examples of questions to ask are: 
* "Do you have any Plot Twists in your hand?"  
* "Do you have any Fin Fang Fooms in your hand?"  
* "Do you have a 7 cost card in your hand?"

# [Carnage](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-035.jpg)
Set: The Defenders  
**Maximum Carnage**  
Carnage’s power triggers when he stuns or gets stunned. So it’s possible for it to trigger twice in one combat.

# Chameleon
## [Chameleon](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SFO-001.jpg) (MC)
Set: Spidey-Foes  
**Blessing in Disguise**  
If Chameleon appears in the middle of the game, then **Blessing in Disguise** will copy any "appears" powers on face-up **Sinister Syndicate** Supporting Characters on your side.

## [Chameleon](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SYN-007.jpg) (SC)
Set: Sinister Syndicate  
**Master of Disguise**  
Chameleon does copy the **Sinister Six** keyword from your main characters who have that keyword. It doesn’t do anything for him in the game because he’s not a main character – he just wants to feel like a real part of the team.

# [The Champion](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV2-019.jpg)
Set: Crossover Vol. 2  
**Primordial Power**  
(Infinite) ATK means the Champion will always have enough ATK to stun a defender and his DEF will always be high enough to avoid getting stunned by a defender's strike. Although if somehow, the defender also has infinite ATK and DEF, then both characters will get stunned. (In other words, infinite ATK is treated as equal to infinite DEF which results in a stun. It's maths.)

# [Chimichanga](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-021.jpg)
Set: Deadpool & Friends  
Deadpool’s favorite deep-fried burrito has two different costs to use its super power. You must choose which cost to pay – you can’t combine them. For example, you couldn’t pay **(Energy)** and **(Intellect)** and then say Chimichanga twice. That would be madness.

# Climb
Set: Spider-Friends  
Spider-Man and many of his friends and foes are great at climbing up buildings. In the game, this lets them get an advantage before the fighting starts: At the start of your Main Phase, you may exhaust a location on your side to put a +1/+1 counter on your character with Climb. A character can only climb one location per turn and the same location can’t be climbed by more than one character. (You exhaust the location to show that it’s been climbed.) So if you have two locations but three climbers, one of them is out of luck. During your Recovery Phase your exhausted locations will ready the same time your characters do.

# [Cloak](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-044.jpg) 
Set: The Utopia Battles
**Darkforce Channeling**  
**Darkforce Channeling** affects all characters, including ones that appear on your side

**Shifting Loyalties**
See [Shifting Loyalties](#wiki_shifting_loyalties)

# Cosmic Cubes
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra  
Hydra has four different Cosmic Cubes under their control. However, each one has a different Super Power using a different Power Symbol.

# [Cosmo](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-004.jpg) (MC)
Set: Galactic Guardians  
**All Bark, No Flight**  
With **All Bark, No Flight** each power lost grants 1 XP. So if a character loses three powers, Cosmo gains 3 XP. **Note:** (Flight) and (Range) are both keyword powers. A character must lose a power and remain face up in order for Cosmo to gain an XP. Losing powers because a character turned face down doesn't count. 

# [Cyclops](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-001.jpg) (MC) 
Set: The Utopia Battles  
You will draw two cards with **They’ll Follow Him** if you have one Supporting Character that is both (Brotherhood) and (X-Men). Similarly, a multi-affiliation character can satisfy more than one of the requirements of **The Squad I’ve Put Together** and **Trust the Plan**. 

Note: **Trust the Plan** will only put three +1/+1 counters on a character even if you’re using it to satisfy two or more of the requirements. And even if you have several characters of all three required affiliations, Trust the Plan can only ever put three counters on three characters maximum.

# [Dagger](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-041.jpg)
Set: The Utopia Battles  
**Shifting Loyalties**
See [Shifting Loyalties](#wiki_shifting_loyalties)

# [Daken](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BOM-013.jpg)
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**Pheromone Control**  
Daken’s **Pheromone Control** power takes away enemy characters’ powers while they’re in melee combat with him. This will prevent triggered powers like **Shrink** or **Berserker** from triggering in the first place.

# [Daredevil](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-002.jpg) (MC)
Set: The Defenders  
**Radar Sense**  
Daredevil and Rhino have effects that allow an enemy player to spend a (Skill/"Red") or (Intellect/"Yellow") to do something. In this case, they can use a Training Ground or Academy to pay for the effect, but not a special Location like Fisk Tower.

# [Darkhold](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SVH-055.jpg)
See [Marvel Required](#wiki_marvel_required_.28equipment.29)

# [Dark Phoenix](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-020.jpg) (SC)
Set: Crossover  \
**Deconstruct the Universe**  
Dark Phoenix When Dark Phoenix Deconstructs the Universe, an entire concept of the game gets removed for the rest of the game (even if she leaves play). If, as a result of this, the wording of a card’s power is unclear, the part that is unclear does nothing. Here’s how removing each concept works: 

* **+1/+1 and -1/-1 counters:** Remove all of those counters from the game. Remove the phrases “+1/+1 counter” and “-1/-1 counter” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause these counters to enter the game in any way 
 
* **Equipment**: Remove all Equipment cards everywhere from the game. This includes all sides, decks, hands, KO piles, and Equipment that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Equipment cards but don’t currently count as Equipment (such as a face-down resource or an Equipment that has become a character via Arnim Zola’s   
**ESP Box**). Remove the term “Equipment” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Equipment to enter the game in any way.  

* **Keyword text:** Removing this concept doesn’t affect **Flight** and **Range**. Remove all Keyword text from the game, including powers that “can’t be turned off”. Remove the term “Keyword” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Keyword text to enter the game in any way.  
 
* **Levels:** All Main Characters everywhere become Level 1 if possible. Remove all remaining Level 2 and higher Main Characters from the game. Remove all Level Up Powers and XP from the game, and the terms “Level” and “XP” from all card text. Ignore any effects that would cause XP or a Level 2 or higher Main Character to enter the game in any way.  

* **Plot Twists:** Remove all Plot Twist cards everywhere from the game. This includes all decks, hands, KO piles, and Plot Twists that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Plot Twist cards but are not currently Plot Twists (such as a face-down resource). Remove the term “Plot Twist” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause a Plot Twist to enter the game in any way.  

* **Super Powers:** Remove all Super Powers from the game. Remove the term “Super Power” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Super Powers to enter the game in any way.  

# [Dawn](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-011.jpg)
Set: The Buffy Battles
Dawn can’t start the game in a deck. Instead, if Buffy is your Main Character or a Supporting Character in your deck, you get to have a Key pile which includes four copies of Dawn. You can recruit Dawn while Buffy is on your side. If Dawn gets KO’d, she’ll go to your KO pile as normal.

# [Deadpool](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-004.jpg) (MC)
Set: Deadpool & Friends
> Hiya kids, it’s your old pal, Deadpool. Guess what? I’m the First character in the game to go all the way to Level 4. There’s probably a break-the-fourth-wall joke in there somewhere, but I haven’t found it yet. Anyhoo, the powers that be want me to tell you that even though I’m now on two different main character cards, the (X-Men) and (Underworld) versions of me can’t level up into each other.  
> 
> It’s because a main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork. And guess what? I don’t mean to brag but I’m actually a designer now. You know all the cards in this set that you love? That’s right -- I designed them. (All the cards that you hate were designed by those other two dummies.) Designing stuff is sweet. You can pretty much do whatever you want.  
> 
> I like designing so much, I wanted to do some while I was in the game too. My new main character can **nerf** stuff, **errata** stuff, and even **ban** stuff. Check it out:  

**I'm Taking Over From These Idiot Designers**  
  
* **Nerf:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks, and KO piles are 0/1 with 1 and nothing can ever, ever change that.  

* **Errata:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles lose and can’t gain powers (including (*Flight*) and (*Range*)). 
 
* **Ban:** Name a character and choose a number. Put all supporting characters with that name on enemy sides into their owner’s hands. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles have a cost equal to the chosen number and nothing can ever, ever change that. (Except banning it again. You know the old saying: “If you really, really hate a card, ban it twice.”) Any effects that would increase or decrease what an enemy player pays to recruit a banned card are ignored.  

Here are some quick tips:  

* If you steal a character with one of those effects the effect will stop because it’s not an enemy character anymore. Yay! However, if it goes back to an enemy side the effect will turn on again. Boo!  

* When you Ban a character, you can name any number you want. Even a million bazillion. Try it, it’s fun!

* If someone tries to tell you that this isn’t really how nerfing, errata-ing, and banning works, you just take your katana and do some "development” on them, if you know what I mean.

# [Death](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-001.jpg)
Set: Black Order  
**Amortal**
Death is **Amortal** which means:

* She has no level (She is beyond such mortal trappings).  
* She starts with her card that has infinite health. (Her other card has 8 health, also known as sideways infinity.)  
* She can't be face down. If she would be turned face down, switch her with her other card instead and leave it face up. For example when she gets stunned, instead of turning her face down, switch her with her other card which will remain face up. She still suffers other effects from the stun such as losing the +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters, gaining a wound, and becoming exhausted.  
* If she would be hidden, instead switch her with her other card which will remain face up and place her in the ready position.  
* Amortal can't be turned off.
 
Since Death doesn't turn face down, she can be stunned multiple times in a single turn. However, if she takes fatal wounds she's not really defeated. She's just temporarily lost interest in this mortal battle. (The player who was using her is defeated, though.) 

**Note:** While death is technically two cards, you could slip her into a single clear card sleeve with her cards back to back. Then when she would turn face down, you can just flip her to her other "side."  

**Mistress of the Infinity Well**  
**Mistress of the Infinity Well** allows each player to draw an extra card each time you draw cards. For example, when you draw your usual two cards during your Draw Phase, you'll draw an extra one. And if you have a **Genius** in play that lets you draw a card, you'll draw an extra one then, too. 

# [Death Trap](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/PRD-053.jpg) 
Set: The Predator Battles  
While this card is face down in your Resource Row, you can play it as if it was in your hand. If you do, put it into your KO pile as normal, then replace it with the top card of your deck, face down. If you have no cards in your deck, you can still play it, you just won’t be able to replace it.

# Devil Dinosaur
## [Devil Dinosaur](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MMU-113.jpg) Team Affiliations
Set: Monsters Unleashed!  
Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur each have two different team affiliations. Moon Girl is on the Inhumans and Devil Dinosaur is on the Monsters Unleashed team.But both of them are also on the Moon Girl/Devil Dinosaur team. This allows them to Team Attack together or with members of their respective teams.(Keep in mind all members of a Team Attack must share at least one team affiliation.)

## [Devil Dinosaur](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MMU-105.jpg) and Moon Girl (MCs)  
The Main Characters, Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur,go together. You start with both on your side and you’re only out of the game once both are KO’d.

# [Devil Slayer](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/DFX-009.jpg)
Set: The New Defenders  
**Shadow Cloak**  
His **Shadow Cloak** lets him attack hidden and stunned characters. Treat it as a regular attack (both players can play Plot Twists, Power Up, etc.), but keep in mind the face-down character’s powers are turned off and its team affiliation is not available for things like playing a plot twist.

When Devil-Slayer and the defender strike each other: 

* Devil-Slayer can be stunned as normal.  
* A hidden character can get stunned as normal. (Wound it and change it from ready to exhausted.) 
* If Devil-Slayer’s strike would stun an already-stunned character, just wound it instead.

# [Doctor Doom](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-031.jpg) (MC)
Set: The Fantastic Battles  
**Time Platform**  
Doctor Doom's **Time Platform**  does something very odd. It shuffles a card into a deck face up. We suggest you close your eyes when shuffling a deck with a face-up card in it. In a tournament, you can always ask a judge to shuffle the deck if necessary. Once the deck is shuffled, where the card is in the deck is public information, so we also suggest you turn it 90 degrees so it's sticking out of your deck.

# [Doctor Faustus](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SVH-011.jpg)
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra  
**Hypnotic Suggestion**  
Doctor’s Faustus’s Super Power allows you to steal an enemy Supporting Character. This effect is permanent: the character will remain on your side until it gets KO’d or otherwise leaves play. When KO’d, put it into its owner’s KO pile.

# [Doctor Nemesis](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/RES-008.jpg)
Set: Resistance  
**Self-Evolved Intellect**  
Doctor Nemesis He only doubles the +ATK/+DEF from the Plot Twists (not the -ATK /-DEF). If the bonus from the Plot Twist is variable, like from the Plot Twist Nuhumans, calculate the variable first, then double it. Note: +1/+1 counters granted from a Plot Twist are unaffected by Dr. Nemesis.

# [Domino](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-020.jpg)
Set: The Utopia Battles   
**Probability Manipulation**  
**Probability Manipulation** requires Domino to flip a coin when she attacks or defends. If she wins the flip something good happens. Otherwise, the combat proceeds as normal.

# [Dormammu](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu3-001.jpg)
Set: MCU Villains  
**You Will Spend Eternity Dying**  
Dormammu’s **You Will Spend Eternity Dying** power allows you to wound a Main Character as many times as you’d like. For example, you could wound them twice. Or six times. Or three hundred times. Just don’t make any bargains with them.

# [Dr. Curt Connors](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/WEB-012.jpg)
Set: Webheads
**The Monster Within**  
For every Dr. Curt Connors in your deck, you must also bring that many copies of the Lizard which will start in an out-of-game Lizard pile. When **The Monster Within** transforms Dr. Connors after he is stunned, remove him from the game and replace him with a Lizard from your Lizard Pile. 

Since this is a "transformation", the Lizard will keep any counters and effects that Dr. Connors had (including a wound counter since he was just stunned).

You can include up to the usual four copies of Lizard in your deck as well as bring up to four copies for your Lizard pile (one for each copy of Dr. Cur Connors in your deck). If you don't have any Lizards in your Lizard pile, **The Monster Within** won't do anything.

# [Edwin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/PRD-044.jpg)
Set: The Predator Battles  
Each copy of Edwin is Good until he uses **I Like it Here** (even if a previous one has become Evil). Each copy of Edwin can only use **I Like It Here** if that copy of the card has used **I Wouldn’t Do That**.

# [Ego](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu3-003.jpg)
Set: MCU Villains 
**Soon We Will Be All There Is**    
Ego’s **Soon We Will Be All There Is** power allows you to turn a face-down location in your resource row face up to become a supporting character. Once this happens it will stop being a location.

# Electro
## [Electro](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SYN-011.jpg) (SC)
Set: Sinister Syndicate  
**Electrocution**  
Electro introduces a new concept: remaining health. Remaining health is a character’s (Health) maximum minus its wounds. (Maximum (Health) is printed plus any bonus .) For example, when a character with 1  printed (Health) appears, it will have 1 remaining health. If a character has 3 printed (Health) and is getting +1 (Health) from an effect and has 2 wounds, its remaining health is 2 (3 + 1 – 2 = 2).

## [Elektra](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/LEG-068.jpg) (MC)
Set: Legacy  
**Hand Experience**  
Elektra (main character) has a super power that allows you to hide her in your hand until your next turn starts. But if she somehow gets discarded from your hand, shuffled into your deck, or otherwise goes anywhere except into play, then you’ll lose the game at the start of your next turn.

# Emma Frost
## Emma Frost (MC) 
Set: The Utopia Battles  
**Keeper of Law**  
**Keeper of Law** allows a character to strike an additional time in a combat. The character can strike two different characters once each (if they’re being team attacked, for example), or they can strike the same character twice. In the latter case, add the character’s ATK together for each strike and then compare it to the enemy’s DEF. 

Emma’s power can be used any number of times each turn. So if a character ends up being allowed to strike 3, 4, or more times, it works as above. Any number of strikes can be combined against an enemy or split amongst multiple enemies.

## Emma Frost (SC) (H.A.M.M.E.R.)
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**Fluid Forms and Fidelity**  
When Emma transforms via **Fluid Forms and Fidelity**, the card that used to be in play is removed from the game. When she transforms, she keeps her orientation (ready/exhausted, face-up/face-down), all of her counters, and any effects on her.

## Emma Frost (SC) (Resistance)
Set: Resistance    
**Fluid Forms and Fidelity**  
When Emma transforms via **Fluid Forms and Fidelity**, the card that used to be in play is removed from the game. When she transforms, she keeps her orientation (ready/ exhausted, face-up /face-down), all of her counters, and any effects on her.

# Evil Deadpool
Set: Deadpool & Friends   
Made from Deadpool’s discarded body parts that fused back together into a new person, Evil Deadpool gains XP whenever you discard a character. This includes powering up as well as any effect that causes you to “discard” a card (whether you or your opponent controls the effect).

**Merc With an Evil Mouth**  
Evil Deadpool loves being Evil. That’s why he can grant Evil characters on your side the new keyword, Evil Lethal. Evil Lethal works just like regular Lethal except after you KO the supporting defender you laugh evilly. (If you’re unable to laugh evilly you’ll still resolve the effect as much as possible and KO the defender.)  

**It's Like You, But Eviler!**  
Evil Deadpool’s Level 2 super power puts Good characters into play but turns them Evil and adds the word “Evil” at the beginning of their name. Changing their name DOES affect the uniqueness rules. For example, it would allow you to have “Iron Man” and “Evil Iron Man” on your side at the same time. However, you would not be able to add “Evil” to regular Deadpool because then his name would be “Evil Deadpool” which is the same name as your main character. And Evil Deadpool hates Deadpool anyway.

# Facehugger
Set: The Alien Battles  
**Facehuggers and Capturing Characters**   
If you have Ovomorphs in your deck (the eggs that make Facehuggers), you’ll use the Facehugger Pile. 

* The Facehugger Pile includes three Facehugger token characters and one Extended Incubation card. These cards start the game out of play. (If more than one player is using Ovomorphs, they will each use their own Facehugger Pile.)   
* When an Ovomorph is ready to Hatch, reveal a random card from your Facehugger Pile.  
* If you reveal the Extended Incubation card, the Ovomorph doesn’t open yet. Shuffle the Extended Incubation card back into your Facehugger Pile.  
* If you reveal a Facehugger token character, KO its Ovomorph, put the Facehugger into your Back Row, and it captures an enemy supporting character. (It can capture a face-up or stunned supporting character.)  

“Capture” is a new game action that means:  
* Remove the Captive card from the game, but keep any wound counters on it.  
* Put the Captive card next to (or underneath) its Captor to make it clear who its Captor is.  
* When the Captor leaves play, put its Captive back into play stunned in its owner’s back row.  
* You may pay an (Alien/"Space") at the start of your Build Phase. If you do, KO the Facehugger and put its captive into its owner’s KO pile. Then you may put an (Xenomorph) character from your hand into your back row. (This represents the new Xenomorph bursting out of the captive’s chest.)  
* Note: Put the KO’d Facehugger token back into your Facehugger Pile.

# Faith 
Set: The Buffy Battles  
Faith can steal any kind of counter from an enemy defender.

# Falcon
Set: The MCU Battles  
**Air Superiority**  
Falcon’s **Air Superiority** power prevents characters with from striking him. It doesn’t matter if that character is attacking or defending, or if it’s a melee or ranged attack. As long as it has it can’t strike him.

# Falcon Drone
Set: The Predator Battles  
**Bond**  
Some characters have a **Bond** with another character. This allows them to be discarded from your hand to generate a Power Symbol for that other character’s Super Powers. You can do this for that character’s Main or Supporting Character. 

Example: You want to use the Falconer Supporting Character’s **Bait and Switch** Super Power, which costs (Skill/"Red"). You may discard a Falcon Drone from your hand to pay for the Super Power. If a character with Bond is used to generate a Power Symbol for a Super Power with Amplify, the Amplify text will apply

# Falconer (MC) 
Set: The Predator Battles  
**Active Falcon Drone**  
Falconer starts the game with a Falcon Drone from your deck on his side. The Falcon Drone still counts toward your 60 cards when you build your deck. 

**We're the Game**  
His Level Up Power, **We’re the Game**, triggers whenever an enemy player reveals one or more cards. Some effects that would grant 1 XP this way are when a player reveals their hand, when a player reveals one or more cards from the top of their deck, or when a player reveals the cards they draw (due to a Falcon Drone).

# Fantastic Four
Set: The Herald  
**The Core Four**  
**The Core Fourr** requires you to have at least one of the listed characters face up on your side. You can then give any character on your side (not just one of the core four) a combination of four total ATK/DEF. For example, you could give a character +0/+4, +1/+3, +2/+2, +3/+1, or +4/+0. **Note:** You can't use negative numbers here such as +5/-1.

# Fin Fang Foom
Set: Monsters Unleashed!  
Fin Fang Foom and Leviathon Hydra are each able to attack multiple enemies at once. When they do, they will strike with their full ATK against each defender, and the defenders will total up their ATK to strike back.

# The First Evil (MC) 
Set: The Buffy Battles  
If two or more players are playing as The First Evil, they will need to randomly determine who chooses which one takes the first turn.

# Gambit
## Gambit (MC)
Set: Resistance  
**'Dis Card**  
Note that discarding a card includes Power Ups. So each time any character on your side Powers Up, Gambit will gain an XP.

## Gambit (SC)
Set: Resistance  
**Molecular Acceleration**  
**Molecular Acceleration** is a Keyword Power, not a Super Power.

# The Gentlemen 
Set: The Buffy Battles  
**Hush**  
**Hush** prevents players from using effects that require you to “say” something or to “name” something. **Hush** also prevents players from talking. You can still communicate in other ways such as using hand signals, or writing things down. You can also make sounds without using your vocal chords. If a player does speak, do your best impersonation of a Gentleman in order to shush them. (There is no in-game penalty for speaking. It’s just not cool.)

# Ghost Spider (MC)
Set: Webheads  
**You Can Borrow This for a While**  
**You Can Borrow This for a While** grants characters with the chosen name the **Dimensional Wristwatch** keyword. You can recruit a character with **Dimensional Wristwatch** directly from your deck: Announce you're recruiting them from your deck, search your deck for the character, shuffle your deck, and then recruit them (pay its cost and put it onto your side). 

If a character with the chosen name gets put back into your deck somehow it will regain **Dimensional Wristwatch** while it's in your deck.

**Ticket to the Multiverse** lets Ghost-Spider jump from your game to a neighboring game. You must have permission from all players in that game before Ghost-Spider can make the jump into their game.

If no one else is playing near you or you don't have permission to move Ghost-Spider, then remove her from the game until the start of your next turn.

When Ghost-Spider enters another game or gets removed from the game set aside all her counters and Equipment. She will reappear in her original game with those counters and Equipment.

If Ghost-Spider enters anotehr game of Vs. System 2PCG, you decide which player gains control over her. She can attack, gain counters, get stunned, get KO'd, etc., just like in her original game. However, no matter what happens she will go back to her original game at the start of your next turn. When she jumps back, any counters, Equipment, etc. that she gained in the other game will be removed.

If Ghost-Spider enters a game that isn't Vs. System 2PCG, it's up to the players in that game to decide exactly how she works in that game.

# Gilgamesh
Set: Cosmic Avengers  
**The Forgotten One**  
For Gilgamesh's **The Forgotten One**, if there is a game effect preventing you from speaking, he will lose Eternal at the end of the turn.

# Global Information Network
Set: Cosmic Avengers  
In this Arc, we are playing around with how players can use locations besides super powers. In addition to cards like \* Thor \* and Hyperion (who have keyword powers which requires spending an (Intellect/"Yellow) and (Energy/"Blue")), each Issue will have a Plot Twist and Special Location that allow their main characters to have some pretty powerful effects on the game. A few things about these Plot Twists and Special Locations:

* They are not super powers.  
* Your main characters ust be face up to pay for them.  
* Your main characters can use a "Wild" Special Location from their team to pay for them.  
* These cards are neutral, so just like any other neutral cards, they can be in Loyalty decks.  
* The Special Locations don't count as location swith a specific power symbol (for powers like Black Widow Main Character's Level Up power **Red in Her Ledger** or ZZutak's **Paint to Life**).

# Glory 
Set: The Buffy Battles  
**Drain Sanity**  
**Drain Sanity** gets more powerful each time you use it, even if you use it on two (or more) different copies of Glory

# Goblin Queen
Set: A-Force  
**Token Characters**  
Goblin Queen has the power to make token characters. A token character works just like a regular character except that if it ever gets put into a KO pile or otherwise leaves play, remove it from the game.

# Gorgon
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra  
**The Spear in the East**  
Gorgon’s power removes the stat benefit from +1/+1 counters on enemy characters. They still count as having the counters though. For example, if an enemy character with two +1/+1 counters gains a -1/-1 counter, you’ll still remove one of each counter type.

# Green Goblin (MC)
Set: Crossover  
The Sinister Six have gained two new Main Characters to choose from. Remember, when you build a Sinister Six deck, you choose any six Sinister Six characters to go with that deck.

**Bag of Tricks**  
Goblin’s Bag of Tricks allows you to discard Locations to make him more powerful in combat. If this causes Goblin to strike “before each other character,” this means he strikes first even if any of the characters have, for example, a power like Ferocious. And if two Goblins are in combat with that ability, they’ll strike each other at the same time. If you discard an Oscorp Location, it’s like a wild: you can treat it as though it’s any of the other four Locations that you didn’t already discard this combat.

# Hawkeye (MC)
Set: Cosmic Avengers  
**Custom Quiver**  
Hawkeye's **Custom Quiver** means he starts the game with his 4 different Custom Arrows Plot Twists set to the side. Once he's level 2, you may use **I Am the Weapon** to draw a random **Custom Arrows** card each turn. Once a custom Arrow card is in your hand, it acts just like a regular Plot Twist. Note that to be able to play any of them, Hawkeye must be face-up on your side, but for the Combat PLot Twists he doesn't have to be in the combat himself (he can shoot really far). 

Please note that if you choose **Magnetic** on the **Utility Arrowheads** card, you *can* move the enemy equipment to an unequipped character on your side. Some of Hawkeye's **Custom Arrows** Have keywords and terms that aren't explained in full on them: 

* **[Sniper](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_sniper)**   
* **[Stealth](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_stealth)**  
* **[Lethal](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_lethal)**  
* **[Violent](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_violent)**  
* **[Shrink](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_shrink)**  
* **[Freeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_freeze)** 

# Headsman
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**Executioner**  
**Ferocious** means – While in melee combat, Headsman strikes before characters without Ferocious.

# Hobgoblin
Set: Spidey-Foes  
**Nothing Without the Green Goblin**  
As Hobgoblin appears, **Nothing Without the Green Goblin** will copy any "appears" powers on face-up Green Goblin characters on your side (like **Blast**).

# Hulk
## Hulk (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
See [Bruce Banner](#wiki_bruce_banner_.28and_the_hulk.29_.28mc.29)

## Hulk (SC - Photo)
Set: The MCU Battles  
**Hulk Like Raging Fire**  
Hulk’s **Hulk Like Raging Fire** power allows you to choose any number to give him that much ATK and DEF during combat. “Any number” means any whole number. Some popular examples are 7, 15, 211, 45,000, 100,000,000, and 9.

## Hulk (SC - Illustrated)
Set: The New Defenders  
**Puny Weapons Can’t Hurt Hulk**  
Hulk’s **Puny Weapons Can’t Hurt Hulk** power means that Lethal wounds (and even Evil Lethal wounds) won’t KO him. This also includes, but is not limited to, things like Gamora’s Godslayer Blade and MCU Drax’s Finger on Throat Means Death.

# Hydro-Man
Set: Spidey-Foes  
**Fluid Tactics**  
**Fluid Tactics** lets you convert ATK from a **Combat** Plot Twist into DEF (or vice versa). For example, if you play a Plot Twist that gives him +3 ATK, you could have him gain +3 DEF instead. It has to be all or nothing. You can't play a Plot Twist that gives him +3 ATK and convert it into +2 ATK and +1 DEF.

Note: +1/+1 counters granted from Plot Twists can't be converted by **Fluid Tactics**.

# Hyperion
Set: Cosmic Avengers  
**Reliance on Solar Energy**  
Hyperion's **Reliance on Solar Energy** is not a super power. Note that the enemy main character must be face up in order to pay the required (Energy/"Blue"). But it doesn't have to be in the combat.

# Impersonating Powers
Set: Utopia Battles   
Several characters have powers that impersonate other characters. These powers turn off immediately if the character they’re impersonating ever shows up. It doesn’t matter if the character that’s being impersonated is face up or face down or what side they’re on. Either way they count as being on “a side” and will turn off the Impersonation power.

# The In-Betweener
Set: Crossover Vol. 2  
**Duality Itself**  
**Duality Itself** lets you put the In-Betweener onto your side between two turns of the game. You can deven do this after an enemy player's first turn but before your first turn.

The In-Betweener couldn't decide exactly how much cost, ATK, DEF, and health to have so he ended up between two whole numbers. In most cases, his stats work like this. 1 ½ cost means you must pay 1 ½ recruit points to recruit him. So you will have ½ a recruit point left over. 4 ½ ATK means his strikes will stun a 4 DEF character but not a 5 DEF character. 3 ½ DEF means if he is struck with 3 ATK, he won't get stunned, but if he gets struck with 4 ATK he will get stunned. 2 ½ (Health) means 2 wounds won't KO him, but 3 wounds will.

# The Infinity Gauntlet
Set: Black Order  
While equipped, the Infinity Gauntlet allows you to turn any number of face-down Infinity Gem equipment in your resource row face up to show that you've "set" them into the Gauntlet. If a card with Infinity gets put into a KO pile from anywhere, you may shuffle it into its owner's deck. 

If the Gauntlet leaves play, leave the face-up Gems in your resource row as they are. However, you can no longer user their powers. If a character on your side equips the Gauntlet later in the game, those Gems will already be inset and its Wielder can use their power again.

**Infinite Power**  
This allows you to do anything you want for the rest of the game. Hera re some examples of things you could do:

* Put a +1/+1 counter on a character.  
* Take an extra turn.  
* Use a Build Phase power during your Main Phase.  
* Flip your deck over.  
* Institute a shared turn.  
* Win the game (unless there are any effects preventing you from winning the game).  
* Turn off any effects that are preventing you from winning the game.  
* Now win the game.  
* Draw a card.

# Infinity Gems
Set: Black Order  
**Owned By**  
Each of the six Infinity Gems has an "Owned by..." power which lets you play it for free on the appropriate character. For example, The Mind Gem can be played for free on The Grandmaster. You may notice that some of these powers refer to characters that aren't yet part of the game. Weird, right?

# Invisible Boy
Set: The Herald  
**Remove Cosmic Energy**  
**Remove Cosmic Energy** has no duration. Once you've named a super power (including one that is not currently in play if you like) enemy Supporting Characters can't use that power for the rest of the game.

# Ironheart
Set: Crossover  
**We’re All Weirdos Here**  
**We’re All Weirdos Here** lets your Supporting Characters Team Attack even if they don’t share a team affiliation and even if they’re in different rows. If there’s at least one melee attacker and at least one ranged attacker in the same attack, then the attack itself is both a melee and a ranged attack. Note: Each character must still legally be able to attack the defender.

# Iron Monger (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
The owner of a character is the player who brought that card to the game, regardless of which side that character is currently on. So Iron Monger’s **Steal Idea** power will trigger when a character that an enemy player “owns” gets recruited, whether that enemy player recruited it themselves or if you used Iron Monger’s **You Had a Great Idea, Tony** power.

# Isabelle
Set: The Predator Battles  
**Sniper Nest**   
Isabelle’s supporting character has this keyword. Enemy players can turn down any Location with an (Energy/"Blue"), including their “wild” Location, to turn off this effect for a turn.

# Jack Flag
Set: Galactic Guardians  
**Follower**  
Jack's **Follower** grants **Leader** to a main character he team attacks with. While a Leader is team attacking, you choose who the defender strikes back against.

# Jessica Jones
Set: Legacy  
**Psionic Protection**  
This power refers to (Intellect/Light bulb) super powers.
This counts for any super power with the appropriate
symbol in its cost (even if it also has other symbols in
its cost).


# Juggernaut (MC)
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**It’s Gonna Take Something More to Stop Me!**  
Juggernaut is so big and powerful it’s almost impossible to beat him physically. Fortunately (for his enemies) he’s vulnerable to other kinds of attacks. This is represented on his card by his **It’s Gonna Take Something More to Stop Me!** power, which allows enemy players to spend an *Energy* ("Atom"/"Blue") to weaken him. Note: This works just like any other super power – except an enemy player can only use it once per turn during their Main Phase. And keep in mind special locations like Avengers Mansion can’t be used by an opponent on Juggernaut’s power.

# Kaecilius
Set: MCU Villains  
 **Fold Space and Matter**  
Kaecilius’s **Fold Space and Matter** power adds a new rule to Vs. System® 2PCG®: an exhausted resource doesn’t produce recruit points. You can still use an exhausted location to pay for a super power.

# The Kingpin (SC)
Set: The Defenders  
**Underworld Boss**  
The Kingpin Supporting Character has a Super Power where he takes over as your main character. When this happens, your former Main Character becomes a Supporting Character and remains in the game. It can still gain XP and Level Up, but you don’t lose the game if it gets KO’d. Instead, you now lose the game when Kingpin gets KO’d.

# Kraven the Hunter (MC)
Set: Sinister Syndicate  
** Spring the Trap **  
Kraven has a Reaction super power. These types of super powers work a little differently than normal super powers. Reaction powers trigger when a certain condition is met (in Kraven’s case, it’s “when an enemy supporting character appears”). When that happens you can pay a (Skill/"Red"), and if you do, you put three -1/-1 counters on that character. You can use a Reaction super power at any time, as long as its trigger condition is met. However, like other super powers, you can only use it once per turn.

# Lambert
Set: The Predator Battles  
**No Autographs**   
While in play, Lambert has every Good Team Affiliation. This does a variety of things. For example, he can team attack with any other Good characters, and while he is face up, he helps you play any Good Plot Twists.

# Legacy
Set: The Herald  
**Nega-Bands**  
Legacy can pay for **Nega-Bands** by spending either a (Might/"Green") or Negative Zone Location. Spending a Negative Zone means turning a Location named Negative Zone face down in your resource row or discarding one from your hand. (It works just like using a regular Location to pay for a super power except you don't actually generate a power symbol.)

# Leviathon Hydra
Set: Monsters Unleashed!  
See [Fin Fang Foom](#wiki_fin_fang_foom).

# Life on the Hellmouth 
Set: The Buffy Battles  
This Plot Twist puts two characters on your side in a Relationship. This means they can team attack together (even if they’re not on the same team), and while doing so they can’t be struck back by a defender. Once a character in a Relationship leaves play, the Relationship is over.

# Living Tribunal
Set: Galactic Guardians  
**Balances the Multiverse**  
When the Living Tribunal **Balances the Multiverse**, he's removed from the game before he actually appears. Photographic Universe cards are cards that have photographic artwork on them, from TV shows and movies. The other universe is the Illustrated Universe, whose cards are cards with drawn, or illustrated artwork.

# Loki (SC)
The MCU Battles  
**I Am Burdened With Glorious Purpose**  
Loki’s **I Am Burdened With Glorious Purpose** power lets you discard a character from your hand to increase the stats of a character in combat. Loki himself doesn’t have to be in combat to use this power.

# Magik 
Set: New Mutants  
**Summon Soulsword**  
Magik’s **Summon Soulsword** power introduces Equipment tokens to the game. An Equipment token works just like a regular Equipment while it’s in play. But if it ever leaves play, remove it from the game (the same way you would remove a character token).

# Mainframe
Set: Galactic Guardians  
**Stationary**  
**Stationary** prevents Mainframe from moving even if an enemy player uses a push or pull effect on him or rearranges your formation.

**Primary Operating System**  
When Mainframe uses **Primary Operating System** it applies only to characters that are currently on your side. It doesn't apply to characters that appear on your side later that turn.

# Magneto (MC)
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
In this set Magneto gets a whole new main character card, and this time  it goes to Level 3. This card represents Magneto’s desire to bring all mutants together as one. (Note: The version of Magneto can’t level up into the version of him and vice versa. A main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork as it does.)

# Mandarin
Set: The MCU Battles  
Mandarin is really three potential characters in one. If Mandarin is in your deck you’ll need to bring your **Behind the Camera** pile with you which includes two copies of **Trevor Slattery** and one copy of **The Ten Rings**. When Mandarin gets KO’d, you’ll remove him from the game, shuffle your Behind the Camera pile, and randomly put one of the three cards there into your hand. 

This represents who Mandarin really is – lowly actor or deadly warlord. Leave the Behind the Camera pile face down – it’s important that your opponent doesn’t find out who the Mandarin really is until you’re ready to show them.

# Marvel Required (Equipment)
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs Hydra    
This set includes four One of a Kind equipment cards – The Nullifier, Book of Vishanti, Darkhold, and Serpent Crown. Each of these has the (Marvel) symbol on its top right instead of a team affiliation. This means in order to play one, you must have a face-up (Marvel) character on your side. (The Marvel symbol is on the bottom of
Marvel character cards.)

# Mary Walker
Set: The Defenders  
Each version of Mary Walker has a different text box and ATK and DEF, but they all count as Mary Walker and can be used to Power-Up each other. Each Mary has the “One of a Kind” keyword which means you can only have one of that Mary in your deck.

# Masacre
Set: Deadpool & Friends  
Masacre es el Deadpool de México, por eso el texto de su juego está escrito en español. No te preocupes. Si no hablas español, traduciremos sus poderes aquí. Él tiene **Mercenario** lo que significa “**Mercenary**,” y **Letal** lo que significa “**Lethal**.”

# Mastermind
Set: Crossover vol. 2  
When Mastermind appears, you'll create a Tactics pile made of any number of other Masterminds you have in your deck and hand. (Note: You don't have to put every Mastermind from your hand and/or deck into your Tactics pile.) Tactics piles are public. When Mastermind gets attacked, you mach choose to play a random card from your Tactics pile. If you do, follow the instructions under its Tactic. Then put the card into your KO pile. When Mastermind leaves play, you'll leave your Tactics pile where it is. A player can only have one Tactics pile at a time. Later, if Mastermind appears on your side again, and you can (and want to) add more Tactics from your hand or deck, add them to your existing Tactics pile. Note: One of Mastermind's Tactics sets an attacker's ATK to 0 this combat. That character can still gain ATK later in the combat.

# Mattie Franklin
Set: Webheads  
**The Gathering of Five**  
If Mattie is in your deck you can bring a Gift pile, which must include one of each of the five Gifts: Death, Immortality, Knowledge, Madness, and Power. When Mattie uses **The Gathering of Five** choose five different characters on  your side with different names. At least one of these characters must be one of your Main Characters. Then randomly assign one of the five Gifts to each of them. If you don't have at least five characters on your side with different names (or you don't have a Main Character on your side), Mattie can't use **The Gathering of Five**.

The Gift of Death will instantly KO its assigned character. The other four grant new abilities to their assigned characters (some good, some bad). Gift cards are not actually in play. Their cards are just play aids to remind everyone what new abilities each character has gained. If a character leaves play its Gift will no longer affect them (even if that character reenters play). 

# Maximus
Set: Crossover  
**Usurp the Throne**  
**Usurp the Throne** lets Maximus KO another player’s Main Character and take over being that player’s Main Character. However, if they don’t currently have a Main Character, Usurp the Throne won’t do anything.

# Might Makes Right
Set: Black Order  
In this Arc, we are playing around with how players can use locations besides super powers. In addition to cards like Nebula (who has a keyword power which requires spending a (Might/"Green)), each Issue will have a Plot Twist and Special Location that allow their main characters to have some pretty powerful effects on the game. A few things about these Plot Twists and Special Locations.

* They are not super powers.  
* Your main characters ust be face up to pay for them.  
* Your main characters can use a "Wild" Special Location from their team to pay for them.  
* These cards are neutral, so just like any other neutral cards, they can be in Loyalty decks.  
* The Special Locations don't count as location swith a specific power symbol (for powers like Black Widow Main Character's Level Up power **Red in Her Ledger** or ZZutak's **Paint to Life**).

# The Milano
Set: Galactic Guardians  
See [Nova Corps](#wiki_nova_corps)

# Mimic (MC)
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**Absorption History**  
Mimic’s **Absorption History** represents three characters that he’s copied powers from. In game terms it’s a pile that includes exactly three Main Character cards, one Level 1, one Level 2, and one Level 3. They can only be from the Illustrated Universe and they must have three different names (they can’t share a name through AKA). For example, you could have Cyclops Level 1, Dutch Level 2, and Spider-Man Level 3.

During setup when you reveal Mimic as your Main Character, you’ll also reveal the Level 1 character in your Absorption History. Mimic gains its Keyword and Super Powers only when the game begins. When Mimic becomes Level 2, you’ll reveal the Level 2 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Powers and loses the powers of the Level 1 character he was previously copying.

When Mimic becomes Level 3, you’ll reveal the Level 3 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Powers and loses the powers of the Level 2 character he was previously copying.

**Note:** While **Absorption History** is a Keyword and can technically be turned off by certain effects, turning it off doesn’t affect Mimic’s ability to use the pile (it’s locked in from the beginning of the game).

# Mirage
Set: New Mutants   
**Create Illusion**  
Mirage’s **Create Illusion** power lets you put a basic location from your hand into your resource row. Note that the new resource won’t generate any recruit points on the turn it appears. This is because recruit points are only generated at the start of your Recruit Step, which happens before you can recruit characters like Mirage.

# Mister Sinister
Set: Legacy  
**Genetic Manipulation**  
This power grants a Keyword power to a character. Unlike most effects, which only last for a turn or two, this effect lasts until the character leaves play./

# Mister X
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**I Can Predict Your Every Move**  
**I Can Predict Your Every Move** can temporarily reduce the ATK/DEF of a character while in solo combat with Mister X.For example, if a character with a printed ATK/DEF of 4/4 has three +1/+1 counters it is
currently 7/7. However, while in solo combat with Mister X, itsATK/DEF counts as 4/4.

# Mole Man (MC)
Set: The Fantastic Battles  
**Tunnel**  
Mole Man can **Tunnel** beneath enemy resources. If there are any enemy Locations, he must tunnel under those first. If there are none, he can tunnel under a face-down resource. When he **Tunnels**, remove him from the game and place him beneath the card he is tunneling under. At the start of your next turn, put him back onto your side and if the card he was under was a Location, turn it face down. If it was already face down, KO it.

If he is beneath a Location and it gets turned face down (including by being used for a super power) or leaves play, put him into your back row. If he is beneath a face-down resource and it leaves play, put him into your back row.

# Moon Girl
Set: Monsters Unleashed!  
See [Devil Dinosaur](#wiki_devil_dinosaur).

# Morgan Le Fay
Set: A-Force  
**Growing Magic**  
Morgan le Fay’s super power counts how many times you’ve used a power named Growing Magic this game. This means that if you use the power a few times on one card and then later use it on a different card, all of those usages count.

# Mr. Black
Set: The Predator Battles  
**Enhanced Bio-Mask** 
Mr. Black’s super power allows him to attack a face-down (hidden or stunned) character. Treat it as a regular attack (both players can play Plot Twists, Power-Up, etc.), but keep in mind the face-down character’s powers are turned off and its Team Affiliation is not available for things like playing a Plot Twist. 

When Mr. Black and the defender strike each other: 
* Mr. Black can get stunned as normal.  
* A hidden character can get stunned as normal. (Wound it and change its orientation from ready to exhausted.)  
* If Mr. Black’s strike would stun an already-stunned character, wound it instead. Note: A stunned character can’t be stunned (including by having its DEF reduced to 0 or a direct “stun” effect).

# Mysterio
## Mysterio (MC)
Set: Sinister Syndicate  
**Hallucinogenic Gas**  
Mysterio can use his special effects expertise to make any plot twist seem like a (Sinister Syndicate) plot twist. Here are the two in this set:

* Putting the Team Together  
* Sinister Six

When you play a plot twist as a copy of a (Sinister Syndicate) plot twist, ignore everything that’s printed on it, and pretend you just played one of the (Sinister Syndicate) plot twists. You can use any plot twist this way, regardless of its printed team affiliation or timing restriction. For example, you could play an (Avengers) **Combat** plot twist during your Build Phase as a copy of Putting the Team Together.

## Mysterio (SC)
Set: Sinister Syndicate  
**Holographic Projector**  
Plot twists without team affiliations can be played  regardless of the team affiliations you have on face-up characters on your side. So Mysterio’s power means you can play any plot twist in your hand even if you only have, say, (Sinister Syndicate) characters on your side.

# Mystique (MC)
Set: Legacy  
**Identity Theft**  
Mystique’s super power allows her to transform into a different Level 2 Main Character. When she does this, remove her from the game and put the new character into play in the same orientation (ready/exhausted) she was in. Move all counters from her onto the new character, applying any effects (such as Freeze) to the new character. 

Playing with friends, you can choose to transform into any character in your collection, but if you’re playing in a tournament, you must select three Main Character options when you build your deck. You must set them face-down next to your unused Level 2/Level 3 characters. (You don’t need to show them to your opponent.)

# Namor (MC)
Set: The New Defenders  
Namor All three of Namor’s **Rage** powers DO count face-down exhausted enemy characters as well. Likewise, his two **Level Up** powers also DO count facedown exhausted enemy characters as well.

**Atlantis Rises**  
**Atlantis Rises** adds a new row to your side, between your back row and your resource row, for the rest of the game. A player can’t have more than one Atlantis row on their side. Atlantis works just like your front and back rows (you can move characters there during your Formation Step, for example) with the following exceptions: 

* Characters in Atlantis can’t attack.  
* They are ‘protected’ by faceup characters in your front row and back row.  
* They can’t be attacked unless each character in your front and back rows is face down.

# Nebula
## Nebula (MC)
Set: Black Order  
**Thanos's Greatest Creation**  
**Thanos's Greatest Creation** prevents Nebula from having keyword or super powers other than **Passive** (and **Thanos's Greatest Creation**, of course). This includes any granted by an equipment, too. 

**Revenge!**  
Her **Revenge!** power works the say way, but for Thanos, of course.

**Tomorrow is Mine to Sculpt**  
When Nebula gains a power via **Tomorrow is Mine to Sculpt**  she will keep it for the rest of the game. (Although cards like Cosmo or The Nullifier can still turn it off.)

## Nebula (SC - Illustrated)
Set: Black Order  
**A New Order Exists Within the Universe**  
**A New Order Exists Within the Universe** checks to see if an enemy character shares at least one team affiliation with a main character on its side. If the main character has no team affiliation, then no supporting characters on its side can share a team affiliation with it. 

**Note:** This is not a super power even though it requires Nebula to pay a (Might/"Green").

## Nebula (SC - Photo)
Set: The MCU Battles  
**Rivalry**  
Nebula’s **Rivalry** power requires you name a character. You can name any character, including one that isn’t in play.

# New Mutants
Set: New Mutants  
The New Mutants are a part of the (X-Men) team. However, there are certain effects that reference “New Mutants” specifically, which means they have a card number that begins with “NEW”.

# Nick Fury (MC)
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra  
**Infinity Formula**  
Nick Fury has a Super Power which keeps him alive. But once you use the power the first time, you must continue using it on each of your successive turns. Otherwise Fury will get KO’d.

# Nikki
Set: Galactic Guardians  
**Mercurial Personality**  
**Mercurial Personality** allows you to **Burn** an enemy supporting character. This means "At the end of each of your turns, stun that character." (**Note:** "You" refers to the player who used Nikki's effect.) A Burn effect has no set duration - it will last until the character leaves play.

# Norman Osborn (MC) 
Set: The Utopia Battles  
Norman’s Level 2 Keyword Powers also affect himself. 

Note: Dark Avengers, Dark X-Men does not give your (Avengers) and (X-Men) characters the (H.A.M.M.E.R.) team affiliation

# Nova Corps
Set: Galactic Guardians  
In this Arc, we are playing around with how players can use locations besides super powers. In addition to cards like Nikki (who has a keyword power which requires spending an (Alien/"Space")), each Issue will have a Plot Twist and Special Location that allow their main characters to have some pretty powerful effects on the game. A few things about these Plot Twists and Special Locations: 

* They are not super powers.  
* Your main characters must be face up to pay for them. (But it doesn't have to be in the combat to pay for Nova Corps.)  
* Your main characters can use a "Wild" Special Location from their team to pay for them.  
* These cards are neutral, so just like any other neutral cards they can be in Loyalty decks.  
* The Special Locations don't count as locations power symbol (for powers like Black Widow Main Character's Level Up power **Red in Her Ledger** or Zzutak's **Paint to Life**).

# The Nullifier
See [Marvel Required](#wiki_marvel_required_.28equipment.29)

# Omega Machine Components 
These are four different One of a Kind Equipment that have the same name. Unlike characters, Equipment are not unique so you can have any number with same name in play at the same time. Because these have the (H.A.M.M.E.R.) symbol, you must have a face-up character with in order to play them.

See also: [Machine](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_machine)

# Omega Red
Set: Crossover  
**Carbonadium Tentacles**  
The phrase “could melee attack” means Omega Red can legally attack that character(s) right now. Normally this just means he must be ready and the character(s) must be unprotected.

# Onslaught
Set: Legacy  
**Joint Consciousness**  
Onslaught’s power occurs when you pay to recruit him, but before he appears. This way he will trigger any “appears” powers on cards he removed from the game.

# Oz
Set: The Buffy Battles  
**Lose Control**   
**Lose Control** lets an enemy player force Oz to strike another Supporting Character. If Oz’s ATK is greater than or equal to that character’s DEF, Oz stuns that character.

# Phil Coulson
## Phil Coulson (Illustrated)
Set: Crossover  
**Special Agent**  
Coulson’s **Special Agent** power means when a character with Agent appears on your side, you’ll get to look one card deeper into your deck.

**Level 7 Clearance / I'm a Guy With a Plan**  
His **Level 7 Clearance** and **I’m A Guy With a Plan** count each instance of **Agent** on a character, so FitzSimmons will count as two Agents. And **I’m a Guy With a Plan** will count Coulson himself.

## Phil Coulson (Photo)
Set: MCU heroes  
**They Need Someone to Avenge**  
Phil’s They Need Someone to Avenge power is not optional. If he’s in your KO pile at the start of your Main Phase, you must remove him from the game and then you can put +1/+1 counters on your characters.

# Pixie (MC)
Set: The Utopia Battles  
**Souldagger** 
**Souldagger** causes a character to lose each modifier it gained during combat. A modifier is an effect that modifies the game. There are two types of modifiers – 

A one-shot modifier does something immediately and then is done. Example: “Put two +1/+1 counters on a character.”

 A continuous modifier has an ongoing effect on the game, which may or may not have a duration. Example: “Choose a character to get +2/+0 and **Lethal** this combat.” 
 
When Pixie uses **Souldagger**, it will cause an enemy character to lose any continuous modifiers that are applying to it. (It won’t stop any one-shot modifiers because it’s impossible for there to be any one-shot modifiers happening while you use **Souldagger**.) 

**Half-Fairy**  
**Half-Fairy** will give Pixie an XP when any character (including an enemy) pays an (Energy/"Blue"). This includes when a character uses an (Engergy/"Blue") Super Power, or choosing to spend an (Energy/"Blue") when you play the Plot Twist **Sacred Ground**.

# Power Man
Set: The New Defenders  
Some characters are known by more than one moniker - like Power Man, who says **AKA Luke Cage**. He counts as having both names, which means you can use a Luke Cage supporting character to Power Up Power Man, and vice versa. It also means they both count as the same person for the purposes of the Uniqueness rules.

**Crash the Party**  
Power Man loves a good party, especially if he wasn’t invited. His Crash the Party power counts each enemy power, even if there are multiple instances of the same power. But remember face-down characters lose their powers so he won’t count their powers.

# Professor X (MC)
Set: New Mutants  
In this set the Professor gets a whole new main character, and this time he goes up to Level 3. (Note: This new Professor X can’t level up into the old one from The Marvel Battles set and vice versa. A main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork as it does.) 

**Graduation**   
Professor X’s **Graduation** power lets you turn an (X-Men) supporting character into the main character version of that character. (Once it’s become a main character it can level up normally. Professor X is a really good teacher.)

This allows you to have any number of main characters in play at once. However, Professor X is still your MAIN main character – if he gets KO’d you’ll lose the game. (Your other main characters getting KO’d won’t cause you to lose the game.)

# Pyro
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**Fire Manipulation**  
Pyro’s Fire Manipulation power lets him create a supporting character creature that has the stats of a random character from your deck. The new character uses a physical supporting character card but erases its name, team affiliation, and game text and powers and replaces them with the name Fire Man, the (Brotherhood) team symbol, and the Creature keyword. (Which means it can’t have equipment.) When it’s KO’d or otherwise leaves play the card will go back to counting as the character printed on it.

# The Reality Gem
Set: Black Order  
You can use this Gem to turn cards in play face up. If you choose a stunned character this counts as recovering it. If you choose a hidden character, it counts as un-hiding it. If you choose a face-down location, it will turn face up. If you choose any other type of face-down resource (including an Infinity Gem), it will remain face down. (It should be revealed to each player to prove that it's not a location). 

You can also use the Gem to turn cards in play face down. If you do this to a ready character, it counts as hiding it. If you do it to an exhausted character, it counts as dazing it (i.e. stun it but it doesn't gain a wound). 

If you do it to an equipment, that equipment will stay equipped but its powers are temporarily turned off. It will turn face up again when the characters on that side would recover. If you do it to a location or face-up Infinity Gem, it will turn face down.  

# Rhino
## Rhino (Sinister Syndicate)
Set: Crossover  
**Headlong Charge**  
Rhino “Sidestep” means that the defender stays where it is, but avoids Rhino just enough. The defender doesn’t count as moving. When an enemy front row character sidesteps, you’ll get to pick a new defender in their back row. If there aren’t any, the combat will end. Sorry Rhino!

## Rhino (Underworld)
Set: The Defenders  
Daredevil and Rhino have effects that allow an enemy player to spend a (Skill/"Red") or (Intellect/"Yellow") to do something. In this case, they can use a Training Ground or Academy to pay for the effect, but not a special Location like Fisk Tower.

# Roberta
Set:  The Herald  
**Receptionist**  
**Receptionist** prevents Roberta from leaving the front row. This means she can't be moved to the back row during your Formation Step, and she ignores any card effects that would move her out of the front row. However, an effect could move her from one player's front row to another player's front row.

# Rocket
Set: The MCU Battles  
**I’m Gonna Need a Few Things**  
Rocket’s **I’m Gonna Need a Few Things** power requires you to choose two cards with different names in your KO pile. If you don’t have two cards with two different names, his power will have no effect.

# Rogue
## Rogue (MC)
Set: Resistance
Note that if she Powers Up while Level 1 or 2, Rogue will gain an XP. Also, her **Force Transfer** and **Life Transfer** will each give her 2 XP when they are used.

## Rogue (SC)
Set: A-Force  
**Absorb Powers**  
Rogue has the ability to gain the keyword and super powers of supporting characters she’s KO’d. When she does this, if that character’s power refers to its own name, use Rogue’s name instead.

# Royce
Set: The Predator Battles  
**We’re Going to Kill Them All**  
Royce’s supporting character has this Super Power. It allows him to move a wound from an enemy character (even an enemy Main Character) to an enemy Supporting Character. The characters must be different. The first character counts as being healed and the second character counts as being wounded.

# The Runner
Set: Crossover vol. 2  
The Runner is so fast he can actually attack during your Build Phase. This means you can recruit characters and equipment after the Runner attacks. (You could even recruit a new copy of Runner and attack with it!) Note: The Runner attacking during the Build Phase does count as a regular Combat so **Combat** Super Powers and Plot Twists, and power ups can be used during a Build Phase combat. However, during the combat you can't use any **Build** Super Powers and Plot Twists.

# Sacred Ground 
Set: The Utopia Battles  
This Plot Twist lets a character pay any power symbol. You can generate a power symbol in the usual ways -- by turning a Location that makes a power symbol face down, or by discarding a Location that makes a power symbol.

# Sauron
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**Terrifying Delusions**  
Sauron’s **Terrifying Delusions** power tricks a main character into striking a supporting character on their side. When this happens compare the main character’s ATK to the supporting character’s DEF to see if it gets stunned. This doesn’t count as a combat and there will be no strike back.

# Scarlet Spider
## Scarlet Spider (MC)
Set: Spider-Friends  
Before he was the Scarlet Spider, the man who would become Ben Reilly was created from Peter Parker’s DNA to be a perfect clone. So in the game he actually starts off as a different “Spider” hero until his true self is revealed (once he reaches Level 2). Here’s how it works: 

Your Spider Web is a new out-of-play pile that includes up to one copy of every other Level 1 main character with “Spider” in its name. (Currently this includes Spider-Man from The Marvel Battles expansion, *Spider-Man* from Monsters Unleashed, and Spider-Man and Spider-Woman from this Issue.) 

Your Clone Pile is another out-of-play pile. It starts empty but during the game you’ll put characters from your Spider Web into it. 

Before the game begins, when each player reveals their main character, you’ll reveal the Scarlet Spider. Then instead of putting him on your side during setup, you’ll put a character from your Spider Web onto your side. 

When that character would become Level 2, you’ll instead transform it into Level 2 Scarlet Spider. (It will keep its counters, any effects on it, and its ready/exhausted and face-up/facedown orientation.) Then put the Level 1 main character he started the game as and the Level 1 Scarlet Spider main character into your Clone Pile. 

Once he’s Level 2, if he would be wounded, there’s a chance it was just a clone body instead: reveal a random card from your Clone Pile. If you reveal Scarlet Spider, he’ll get wounded as normal – they found you! But if you reveal someone else, he doesn’t get wounded (although whoever was revealed goes back into your Spider Web.)

## Scarlet Spider (SC)
Set: Spider-Friends  
**Paralytic Darts**  
Scarlet Spider Scarlet Spider’s **Paralytic Darts** cause an enemy character to become immobilized indefinitely. This effect lasts even after Scarlet Spider leaves play. (It will end once the immobilized character leaves play.)

# Scarlet Witch
Set: The Defenders  
**Hex**  
Scarlet Witch’s **Hex** power prevents enemy Main Characters from Leveling Up. They can still gain XP up to their Level Up number, but not beyond. And once Scarlet Witch gets stunned or leaves play, if they have enough XP, they’ll immediately Level Up.

# Scourge
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**Betsy’s Incendiary Missiles**  
**Betsy’s Incendiary Missiles** lets you **Burn** a character. This means “At the end of each of your turns, stun that character.” A Burn effect has no set duration – it will last until the burning character leaves play.

# Secret Hideout
Set: Spidey-Foes  
**Family is a Source of Weakness**  
**Family is a Source of Weakness** lets your (Sinister Syndicate) Main Character take a **Hostage**. If you have any Secret Hideouts in your deck, you must bring a Hostage pile, which includes one ore more *different* (Spider-Friends) Supporting Characters with the **Friends and Family** keyword.

When you play Secret Hideout, one of your Main Characters takes a **Hostage**. Choose a character from your Hostage pile and put it beneath the Secret Hideout as a **Hostage**. Your Main Character gets the Keyword Power granted by that Hostage *while that Main Character is in your front row*.

For example, if you take Mary Jane hostage, your Main Character will gain **Pounce** while it's in  your front row. (It doesn't have to be protecting anyone.)

When that Main character gets stunned or leaves play, turn the Secret Hideout face down and set the **Hostage** aside. (It doesn't go back to your Hostage pile.) Similarly, if an effect turns the Secret Hideout face down, set the **Hostage** aside. Once the **Hostage** card is no longer beneath the Secret Hideout it also stops granting its Keyword Power.

It's possible for the same Main Character to have multiple Hostages (one for each Secret Hideout you play while you have that Main Character). 

Note: A **Hostage** is never actually in play. It's either in a Hostage pile, beneath a Secret Hideout, or set aside (after leaving a Secret Hideout).

# Sentry
Set: The Utopia Battles  
**Reluctant God**  
**Reluctant God** prevents Sentry from striking, but he can still attack.

# Serpent Crown
See [Marvel Required](#wiki_marvel_required_.28equipment.29)

# Shadow King
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**Anchor Host**  
Shadow King is technically a supporting character but he doesn’t want to actually be in play. He prefers to have a physical host. If he would appear for any reason, you’ll remove him from the game instead and choose a face-up character on your side to be his Host. If you don’t have a face-up character, Shadow King will still be removed from the game. When his Host gets stunned or leaves play Shadow King will remain removed from the game

# She-Hulk (MC)
Set: A-Force  
**Rules Lawyer**  
She-Hulk’s main character introduces a new kind of super power called a **Reaction**. It reads: 

> Reaction : When an enemy player uses a super power, you may say “Objection!” If you do, cancel that super power.

Reaction powers trigger when a certain condition is met (in this case it’s “When an enemy player uses a super power”). When that happens you can pay an (and say “Objection” of course) and if you do it cancels the super power so it never takes effect.

You can use a Reaction power at any time, as long as its trigger condition is met. However, like other super powers, you can only use it once per turn.

# Shifting Loyalties 
Set: The Utopia battles  
At the end of your turn, if there is an enemy (Brotherhood), (Resistance), or (X-Men) character on more than one side, Shifting Loyalties will trigger once for each side. First you’ll get to choose which side your character moves to. Once there it will lose its (H.A.M.M.E.R.) affiliation, so the remaining times **Shifting Loyalties** had triggered won’t do anything.

See also: [Cloak](#wiki_cloak) and [Dagger](#wiki_dagger)

# Sif
Set: Crossover  
You can only recruit her by also paying a Might *(Fist/Green)*. If you don’t have one to pay, you can’t recruit her. Note: If she appears somehow without getting recruited, you don’t have to pay a Might *(Fist/Green)*.

# Silver Surfer (MC)
Set:  The Herald  
**Take a Stand**  
**Take a Stand** allows you to spend any team's special Location that has (Humanity/"Earth"). For example, you could use the (Monsters) Mu Location to generate a (Humanity/"Earth") for the Silver Surfer.

**Protect the Earth**  
**Protect the Earth** will return the highest cost Supporting Character to its owner's hand, whether that character is on your side or on another player's side.

# Simon Trask (MC) 
Set: The Utopia Battles  
**Proposition X**  
**Proposition X** works like this. When an enemy character appears, check each of its team affiliations against each team affiliation on characters on your side. For each affiliation the enemy character has that is NOT shared, Trask gains 1 XP. 

**Biosentinel**  
**Biosentinel** is a keyword power that has no built-in effect. Instead it is referenced by Trask’s other powers.

# Sinister Six 
Set: Sinister Syndicate  
If you’re playing with the Sinister Six, you actually have six main characters instead of one. Here’s how it works: When you build a Sinister Six deck, choose six main characters with **Sinister Six** to make up your Sinister Six Pile.

Before the game begins, when each player reveals their main character, you’ll reveal each main character in your Sinister Six Pile. Then when you would put your main character on your side during setup, choose any character in your Sinister Six Pile and put it on your side. 

During the game, when your Sinister Six main character gets KO’d remove it from the game but you don’t lose the game – unless your Sinister Six Pile is empty. At the start of your next turn, choose one of the remaining characters in your Sinister Six Pile and put it onto your side. 

The **Sinister Six** keyword can’t be turned off.

Keep in mind when choosing your next Sinister Six main character, you can choose one with the same name as a supporting character on your side – but if you do, that supporting character will be KO’d.

# Soldiers
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra  
Several (Hydra) characters have the new **Soldier** Keyword Power, which allows them to work together to take out an enemy. When a Soldier appears, put -1/-1 counters equal to the number of Soldiers on your side onto an unprotected enemy Supporting Character. The more Soldiers you have, the better they’ll be at hurting an enemy.

# SP//dr
Set: Crossover Vol. 2
Even though its name is spelled differently it still counts as being "Spider" for the purpose of powers that reference the word "Spider", such as * Spider-Man *' s **Spider-People**. It's just how they spell in the future!

SP//dr must not have any wounds at the start of your turn in order for its **Genius** power to trigger. So even if **Regeneration** heals SP//dr's last wound, you won't get to draw from **Genius** that turn.

# Specialized Web Cartridges
Set: Webheads  
**Spider-Gear**  
**Spider-Gear** is a keyword that means this Equipment can only be equipped to a character with "Spider" in its name. Each Specialized Web Cartridge grants (Range) and an attack power. Note: The attack power will trigger whether the equipped character is making a melee or ranged attack.

# Spider-Gwen
Set: Legacy  
**Dimensional Wristwatch**  
Spider-Gwen can be recruited while she’s in your deck. To do so, announce that you’re recruiting her, then search your deck for her, shuffle your deck, and then pay to recruit her. (Note: You may only announce that you are recruiting her if she actually is in your deck.)

# Spider-Man
## Spider-Man (MC)
Set: Spider-Friends  
**I Can and Will Fight You**
This issue introduces the powerful Alien Symbiote version of Spider-Man. But as they say, with great alien power comes great alien… danger. While the symbiote does make him stronger, he must remove it or it will quickly be game over. In the comics, when Spider-Man fights off the symbiote, it splits off from him as a separate entity. In the game, when Spider-Man sheds the symbiote, it splits off from him as a separate card. When this happens, Spider-Man will become Level 2 and now wears a cloth version of his black costume and the Alien Symbiote will look for a new host. (Note: Spider-Man Level 2 has one less Health – this represents losing the strength of the symbiote.) 

When a character with the Alien Symbiote is turned face down but isn’t KO’d, just keep the equipment token face up and ready, just like when it’s equipped to a face-up character (it doesn’t exhaust or turn face down). And remember, the symbiote is a jealous entity – it can’t be destroyed or removed from its host (at least until the host leaves play).

## Spider-Man (SC - Spider-Friends)
Set: Spider-Friends  
**Spider-Powers**  
Spider-Man’s **Spider-Powers** do not have a limited duration. Any new keywords he gains will last until he leaves play.

## Spider-Man (SC - Webheads)
Set: Webheads  
**Tony's Tinkering**  
When **Tony's Tinkering** lets Spider-Man download an **Update**, put an **Update** counter on him. (You can use a coin, bead, slip of paper, or an XP counter to keep track of Spidey's **Updates**). When Spidey installs **Updates**, you may remove any number of **Update** counters from him.

If you remove exactly one **Update** he gains (Flight) and (Range) until he leaves play. If you remove exactly two **Updates**, put two vitality counters on him. If you remove exactly three **Updates**, put twelve +1/+1 counters on him.

You can remove the same number of **Updates** more than once. For example, if you remove the two **Updates** for a second time, Spider-Man will get two more vitality counters.

Note: **Update** counters aren't removed from Spidey when he gets turned face down. However, they are still removed when he leaves play.

# \* Spider-Man \*
Set: Crossover Vol. 2  
**Citizen of the Multiverse**  
Miles Morales doesn't technically have the **Spider-Verse** keyword, but he likes to hang out with his multiversal friends. * Spider Man *'s **Citizen of the Multiverse** means your deck may include up to four different **Spider-Verse** Main Characters. 

These characters **do** count toward your total of 60 cards in your deck. If * Spider-Man * gets KO'd, you're not out of the game if you ahve at least one of your other Main Characters on your side.

# \*\* Spider-Man \*\* 
## \*\* Spider-Man \*\* (MC)
Set: Webheads  
**Oz Formula**  
This Spider-Man, from the Ultimate Universe, is our first character to share a mantle with two other people! (Miles Morales and the main Marvel Universe's Peter Parker.) In this comics, this Peter died... but then came back to life because the **Oz Formula** that gave him his powers also granted him immortality. For the game, this means when Peter is KO'd, you won't lose the game immediately for not having a main character. You'll have until the end of your next turn to bring him back when a Supporting Character with the **Friends and Family** keyword appears on your side. In this case, put him back onto your side with wounds equal to his (Health) minus 1. (With the **Oz Formula** mechanic, Peter can continue fighting for those he cares about.)

## \*\* Spider-Man \*\* (SC)
Set: Webheads  
**Ultimate Spider-Man**  
**Ultimate Spider-Man** lets Spidey strike multiple times in a combat. If he strikes the same character more than once, add his ATK together for each strike and then compare it to the enemy's DEF. For example, if he has 5 ATK and strikes a character three times compare a total of 15 ATK to that character's DEF. He can also split up his strikes if he's in combat with multiple enemies (such as if he's being team attacked).

# Spider-Man Noir
Set: Crossover Vol. 2  
**Black and White**  
**Black and White** prevents enemy Locations from producing the power symbol of your choice. An enemy player can still turn a Location face down or discard it from their hand to try to produce that symbol, but nothing will happen.

# Spider-UK (MC)
Set: Webheads  
**Spider-Verse**  
A British Spider-Man from another Universe, Spider-UK is a new Main Character with the **Spider-Verse** keyword. **Spider-Verse** means two things:

First, if you choose a **Spider-Verse** character to be your starting Main Character you can include up to four other **Spider-Verse** Main Characters in your deck when you build it. (Four other Spider-Verse Main Characters premiered in the 2019 Vs. System 2PCG: Crossover Vol 2 Issue.)

Second, during your Build Phase, if a character with **Spider-Verse** is in your hand, you may put it onto your side. 

Note: Spider-UK can be powered up by any character with "Spider" in their name, which includes Main Characters that are in your hand.

# Squirrel Girl
Set: Legacy  
**Let’s Get Nuts**  
Squirrel Girl’s power lets her put token characters into play. A token character works just like a regular character except that if it ever gets put into a KO pile or otherwise leaves play, it ceases to exist. The token card can be reused later if Squirrel Girl appears again.

# Stand Together
Set: Crossover  
**Stand Together** introduces **Reaction** Plot Twists to the game. When an enemy character uses a Super Power, after they pay any required power symbols, you can play **Stand Together** to cancel it before it takes effect. You must have at least as many face-up characters as the number of power symbols they paid. (If they paid none, then you don’t have to have any face-up characters.)

# Star Hawk
Set: Galactic Guardians  
**Composite Being**  At one point Starhawk was actually two beings merged together who took turns occupying the same space. The Starhawk card from way back in the Vs. System 2PCG: Legacy expansion represents Stakar Ogord, but this card brings Aleta Ogord to the fore. Because they share the same body, you cant have both Starhawks in play at the same time. However, Aleta's **Composite Being** grants **Bond with Starhawk** to any Stakar Starhawks in your hand.

# Star Lord
## Star Lord (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
**Dance Off, Bro**  
Star-Lord (Main Character) Star-Lord’s Level Up power lets you start a Dance Off. Starting with you, each player may exhaust one of their ready characters or they’re out of the Dance Off. Repeat this process until only one player is left. They’re the winner.

## Star Lord (SC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
**Half Celestial**  
Star-Lord’s **Half Celestial** power prevents him from being KO’d as long as you have a face-up main character on your side. However, if Star-Lord has fatal wounds and your main character gets turned face down, Star-Lord will immediately become KO’d.

# \* Star Lord \*
Set: Galactic Guardians  
Kitty Pryde becomes Star-Lord when the original Star-Lord is otherwise employed. So she has *s around her name, meaning she shares the "mantle" with Star-Lord, himself. The sharing of the mantle means both characters can be on a side at the same time because they're different beings, just with the same name. So you don't KO either because of the uniqueness rules and they can't power each other up.

Note that although this card represents her joining the Guardians of the Galaxy she's still an X-Men at heart, so she has both team affiliations.

**Intangibility**  
Her **Intangibility** power lets her strike characters while they're in a player's hand. This is uncanny. A couple things about this: 

* She can strike any number of 0 DEF characters (or characters with * DEF).  
* She can strike characters who normally couldn't be struck by her while on a side (like Bulletproof characters) because those powers aren't active while the character is in a hand.  
* It doesn't matter how much (Health) a struck character has, it gets discarded. 

# Storm
Set: Resistance  
**You Can’t Weather This Storm**  
**You Can’t Weather This Storm** is a Keyword Power, not a Super Power.

# Sunspot
Set: New Mutants   
**Solar Absorption**  
Sunspot’s **Solar Absorption** power is not optional. At the start of your Main Phase, you must turn a basic location face down, even if you’re the only player with one.

# Supergiant
Set: Black Order  
Both of Supergiant's powers trigger when she appears. You can resolve them in whichever order you like.

# Superior Spider-Man (MC)
Set: Webheads  
**A Superior Hero**  
**A Superior Hero** represents Doc Ock's realization that Peter Parker's selflessness makes Peter the superior hero. When another character on your side is attacked, you may transform Superior Spider-Man into the Marvel Battles Level 2 Spider-Man with **Friendly Neighbor**, remove the defender from combat, and replace it with your new Spider-Man Main Character. Note: Spider-Man will keep all counters, Equipment, effects, and orientation (ready/exhausted) that Superior Spider-Man had.

# Super Skrull (MC)
Set: The Fantastic Battles  
**First Faker**  
Super-Skrull's **First Faker** Level Up power looks at every player's side (not just yours) and it counts Main and Supporting Characters. But if there are, for example, two Human Torches in play, he still only gets 1 XP for Human Torch.  

**Cosmic Energy Power Receptors**
The powers he gains from his **Cosmic Energy Power Receptors** have no duration, so he keeps them until he leaves play. They also look at every player's side (not just yours). Note that if he copies **Stroke of Genius** from Mister Fantastic, he will only be able to **Invent** if you already have an Invention pile for your deck.

# Supreme Leader
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra  
**Hydra High Council**   
Supreme Leader has a Super Power which prevents you from losing the game even after he’s KO’d. Just continue to play without a main character.

# Sweet
Set: The Buffy Battles  
**That's Entertainment**   
**That’s Entertainment** moves each face-up character to their front row and has them perform a Musical Number. There is no official definition of what counts as a Musical Number. We recommend rocking the cards back and forth and having them sing a song. (Although if The Gentlemen are in play, no singing is allowed.)

# Terrigen Mist
Set: Crossover vol. 2  
Terrigen Mist puts +1/+1 counters on each character on your side, including ones that are already exhausted.

# Thanos (MC)
Set: Black Order  
**Resurrected by Death Herself**  
At Level 1, if Thanos gets KO'd by getting stunned, **Resurrected by Death Herself** will cause him to gain an XP and become Level 2 while in the stunned position. (If a power like Hex prevents him from leveling up, he'll remain at Level 1 but still heal his wounds.)

**Schemes and Dreams**  
**Schemes and Dreams**  prevents you from drawing cards during your Draw Phase, including your normal draws plus effects like Genius. However, if Thanos is face down at the start of your turn, Schemes and Dreams will be turned off. This means you can draw cards during your Draw Phase, however you can't search for a card.

**My Quest Begins**  
**My Quest Begins** counts each card that enters your hand from your deck. So if you draw three cards, that would be 3 XP.

**The Universe Will Now Be Set Right**  
**The Universe Will Now Be Set Right**  has a 50-50 chance of removing each character on each side from the game. If this removes a players last main character, that player ;oses the game. If this removes each player's last main character (including Thanos, himself) then the Thanos player wins the game. (This is similar to how if the final two main characters KO each other in combat, the player whose turn it was wins.)

# Thor (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
**Journey of Self Discovery**  
Thor’s **Journey of Self Discovery** Level Up power requires him to make three separate attacks in the order printed on his card to gain an XP. These attacks don’t have to be in a row. For example, he could make a solo attack, then a team attack with one teammate, then another solo attack, and finally when he team attacks with exactly two other characters he’ll gain an XP.

# \* Thor \*
Set: Cosmic Avengers  
Jane Foster becomes Thor when the original Thor shirks his responsibility. She has \*s around her name, meaning she shares the "mantle" with Thor himself. This means both characters can be on a side at the same time because they're different beings, just with the same name. So you don't KO either because of uniqueness rules and they can't power each other up. When Thor is ready to start being "the" Thor again, Jane gracefully demurs. 

**There Must Always Be a Thor**  
To represent this, her **There Must Always Be a Thor** power can only search for a card named "Thor" (with no \*s ) or with **AKA Thor** (like Odinson). It can't get a copy of herself. 

**A God Who Knows How Precious Life Is**  
Jane's **A God Who Knows How Precious Life Is** is not a super power.

# Titan
Set: Black Order
See [Might Makes Right](#wiki_might_makes_right)

# Titania
Set: A-Force  
**Durable**  
Titania has the new **Durable** keyword. This means if she gets stunned in some way that isn’t getting struck in combat, she recovers and doesn’t get wounded. 

However, if she was in the middle of combat when she got stunned (perhaps by Sin’s super power), even though she would recover immediately, getting stunned would still remove her from combat.

# Toad 
Set: Resistance  
**Toadally Awesome**  
Remember, Toad isn’t just Sort of Awesome.

# Tracker
Set: The Predator Battles  
**It Wants Us to Run**   
Tracker has a keyword that says: “Tracker has +1/+1 for each different basic Location type on all sides.” There are six basic Location types, one for each Power Symbol (even though there are more than six different names for these six types): (Humanity/"Earth"), (Alien/"Space"), (Energy/"Blue"), (Intellect/"Yellow"), (Skill/"Red"), and (Might/"Green").

# Trance 
Set: Resistance  
**Astral Form Overload**  
When she has an **Astral Form Overload**, she gains **Stealth** and **Fearless**. **Stealth** means she can melee attack back row characters, even while they’re protected. **Fearless** means that she strikes Main Characters with double her ATK.

# Ultron Facility (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
Ultron is really six main characters in one: three identical Level 1s, two identical Level 2s, and one Level 3. Before the game starts you’ll put one Level 1 Ultron onto your side. The remaining five Ultron cards will start out of play in a face-up pile called your **Ultron Facility**. 

During the game you can use any Ultron’s **There’s Only One Path To Peace** power to put the lowest level Ultron from your Ultron Facility onto your side. When one of your Ultron main 27 characters gets KO’d it goes back to your Ultron Facility where it will be available to be brought back again.

If all your Ultrons are in the Ultron Facility at the same time, you lose the game. 

**Note:** The Level 3 Ultron’s **Your Extinction** power KOs all enemy cards (in a very dramatic way).


# Venom (MC)
Set: Crossover  
The Sinister Six have gained two new Main Characters to choose from. Remember, when you build a **Sinister Six** deck, you choose any six Sinister Six characters to go with that deck.

**Relentless Bond**  
Venom’s **Relentless Bond** will put a +1/+1 counter on him whether or not he’s stunned.

# Vocal Mimicry
Set: The Predator Battles  
Currently, there are only 3 (Predator) One of a Kind Plot Twists that it can copy: “Any Time.”, “Over Here.” and “Turn Around.”

# Vulture
Set: Sinister Syndicate  
**From Above**  
While Vulture is attacking a character without (Flight) that is also in its back row, his **From Above** power will give him +2/+2. Ka kaw!

# Wakanda
Set: Cosmic Avengers  
See [Global Information Network](#wiki_global_information_network)

# Weapon Omega (MC) 
Set: The Utopia Battles  
**Mutant Energy Absorption**  
**Mutant Energy Absorption**’s effect has no duration. So a character that loses and can’t gain powers this way, will remain like that until it leaves play. 

**Addicted to Mutant Energy**   
**Addicted to Mutant Energy** affects a character as it appears, which means it won’t even trigger any of its powers that occur when it appears. It also has no duration, so a character affected by it will remain affected until that character leaves play.

# Willow (SC) 
Set: The Buffy Battles  
**Spell Research**  
Willow’s **Spell Research** power puts Plot Twists into a special pile removed from the game called your Spellbook. Your Spellbook can’t have more than one copy of the same Plot Twist. 

**Spellcasting**  
Her Spellcasting power lets you play Plot Twists from your Spellbook, putting them into your KO pile when they resolve. 

If Willow gets KO’d or otherwise is no longer on your side, you won’t be able to access the Plot Twists in your Spellbook. But if you play another copy of Willow, then you can use your Spellbook again.

# The Wizard (MC)
Set: The Fantastic Battles  
**Wizard Armor**  
Here are the four Plot Twists he has at his disposal:

**Open Fire**  
(Any Combat): Choose an attacker to get +2/+0 this combat.

**Find Cover**  
(Any Combat): Choose a defender to get +0/+3 this combat.

**Savage Surprise**  
(Any Combat): Choose a defender to get +4/+0 this combat.

**Best Offense is a Good Defense**  
(Any Combat): Choose an attacker to get +0/+5 this combat.

# X-23 (MC)
Set: New Mutants  
X-23 is one of the toughest mutants around. So tough in fact that she only has a Level 1 main character. She can’t level up and she doesn’t care.

# Xander (SC) 
Set: The Buffy Battles
When Xander hides, turn him face down but in the ready orientation. Remove all +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters and Equipment from him. A hidden character doesn’t count as being stunned, but it still can’t attack or defend, it doesn’t protect anyone behind it, and loses its powers. It still keeps its other information like name and team affiliation. If a hidden character gets stunned somehow, change it to the stunned orientation (face down and exhausted). A hidden character will turn face up the same time your stunned characters would recover.
