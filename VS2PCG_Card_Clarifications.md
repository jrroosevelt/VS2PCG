# Rule insert card and key ability clarifications

The following clarifications are included in the rule inserts that come with the various sets. 

**Note**: There have been some minor editorial liberties taken (not all are exact quotations from the main source). These changes are mainly cosmetic or made to help understand context outside of the rulesheet and do not fundamentally change the intent of the original text.

# Abomination
Set: MCU Battles  
**Give Me a Real Fight!**  
Abomination’s **Give Me a Real Fight!** Power forces a player’s first attack to include a specific character and the defender must be Abomination. However if either that character can’t attack or Abomination can’t be attacked, the effect does nothing. Also, the player can choose not to attack at all on their turn.

# Agents
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra  
Several (S.H.I.E.L.D.)  characters have the new Agent Keyword Power, which allows them to work together as a spy network. When an Agent appears, look at cards from the top of your deck equal the number of **Agents** on your side. Put any of them on the bottom of your deck. The more Agents you have, the better you’ll be at gathering intel. 

# Ajax
Set: Deadpool & Friends  
**Pain Tolerance**  
Ajax's **Pain Tolerance** power says he can only be KO'd by fatal wounds at the end of a turn. A character has fatal wounds if it has at least as many wounds as its health. So Ajax can have any amount of wounds but won't actually get KO'd until the end of a turn.

# Alcatraz
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**It's a Prison**  
When the character in “prison” turns face up, the player who used Alcatraz decides which row on its original side it goes back to.

Armor 
Set: The Utopia Battles  
**Psionic Exoskeleton**  
**Psionic Exoskeleton** is a combat power, but its effect lasts for the rest of the turn.

# Angel (MC)
Set: Resistance  
When Angel levels up, he transforms into [Archangel](#wiki_archangel). When this happens, he keeps his orientation (ready/exhausted, face-up/face-down), all of his counters, and any effects on him. Also note Archangel doesn’t have a Level 1 version. The only way to become him normally is to start the game with (Resistance) Level 1 Angel as your Main Character.

# Angel/Angelus (MC) 
Set: The Buffy Battles  
Level 1 Angel and Angelus can transform between each other. However, when you build a deck you must choose either Angel or Angelus to be your starting Main Character. (You must lock in your decision at the time you build your deck, not after you see what Main Character your opponent is using.) When Angel transforms into Angelus or vice versa, he keeps his orientation (ready/exhausted, face up/face down), all of his counters (including XP), and any effects on him.

# Anya 
Set: The Buffy Battles
Her **Newly Human and Strangely Literal** power ignores all stat increases including +1/+1 counters. It doesn’t remove the counters – they just have no effect this turn.

# Archangel
Set: Resistance  
**Violent**  
**Violent** means that he strikes Supporting Characters with double his ATK.

# Arnim Zola (MC)
Set: Crossover  
**ESP Box**  
ESP Box takes effect once the game starts and lasts the whole game (even while Arnim Zola is stunned, after he levels up, and even after he is KO’d). You can play any Equipment as a Supporting Character, regardless of whether you have a character with a matching team affiliation. When you play one as a Supporting Character, it’s no longer an Equipment. If it has a power that references “Equipped Character,” it is its own equipped character. When the card leaves play it will go back to being an Equipment. You may still play an Equipment normally and equip it to one of your characters (including on an Equipment that you played as a Supporting Character). 

**A New Robot Body**  
When Arnim Zola enters A New Robot Body, your new Equipment-turned-Main Character will have ATK/DEF equal to its cost, 1 (Health), Swarm, and it will count as its own “Equipped Character,” just like with ESP Box. When that body gets KO’d, it can use this power again to jump into another robot body, and so on. Note: if you want to use a Wild Special Location to pay for this power, it must match the team affiliation of the Main Character using this power.

# Avalanche
## Avalanche (Brotherhood)
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**Sustained Seismic Waves**  
Avalanche’s Sustained Seismic Waves power gets stronger each time he uses it. However, if you play a new copy of Avalanche later, the super power on that copy will start over.

## Avalanche (Resistance)
Set: The Utopia Battles  
**The Big One**
**The Big One** KOs basic Locations with different types. The types are:

* Energy (Blue)  
* Intellect (Yellow)  
* Might (Green)
* Skill (Red)  
* Alien (Space)
* Humanity (Earth)

# Baron Mordo (MC)
Set: Legacy  
**Hypnotize**  
Baron Mordo can revert a main character back to level 1 until your next turn. When the effect wears off, the character goes back to whatever level and card it was before.

# Beast 
Set: The New Defenders  
**Acrobatic**  
Note that **Acrobatic** doubles his DEF whether he is attacking OR defending.

# * Bishop *
Set: Legacy  
**Energy Transference**  
This power refers to (Energy/Atom) super powers.This counts for any super power with the appropriate symbol in its cost (even if it also has other symbols in
its cost).

# Black Bolt
Set: Monsters Unleashed!  
Black Bolt’s Super Powers use the Amplify ability. When you use a Super Power, if you discard a Location (instead of turning it face-down in your resource row), you get the Amplify text. Previous Amplify Super Powers grant an effect to begin with but a larger effect if you Amplify it. Black Bolt’s powers only grant an effect if you Amplify them.

# Black Cat 
Set: Spider-Friends  
**Personal Loyalty**  
Black Cat has often wavered between being a hero and a villain. In the game she doesn’t have a team affiliation and is neither Good nor Evil… until she’s on a side (she is neither Good nor Evil while she is in your hand, deck, or KO pile). Then if Spider-Man is your main character, he has a good influence on her and she’ll ferociously fight alongside her partner. But if he’s not your main character, she’ll go back to slinking around as a criminal.

# Black Panther (MC)
Set: MCU Heroes  
**Vibranium Weave Suit**  
Black Panther Black Panther’s **Vibranium Weave Suit** power prevents him from being struck for the entire turn including the combat he’s currently in.

# Black Panther (SC)
Set: MCU Heroes  
**Bulletproof**  
Black Panther Black Panther’s **Bulletproof** power prevents enemy characters with [Range] from striking him. It doesn’t matter if Black Panther is attacking or defending, or if it’s a melee attack or ranged attack. As long as a character has [Range] it can’t strike him.

# Blob 
## Blob (MC)
Set: Crossover  
**Boing!**  
If Blob strikes a character and his **Boing!** power causes that character to strike itself, you add Blob’s ATK to that character’s own ATK to see if it’s enough to stun it. 

**Immovable Object**  
If Blob moves for any reason (including during your Formation Step or because another effect moves him), he will be prevented from gaining an XP. At the end of Blob’s first turn of the game, he will gain an XP if he didn’t move that turn.

## Blob (SC)
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**Stuck in His Stomach**  
Blob’s Stuck in His Stomach power represents a melee attacker getting temporarily trapped by Blob’s flab. This effect will take place even if Blob gets KO’d in the attack. (Just imagine him unconscious lying on top of the attacker.)
 
**Bounced Off His Belly**  
And his Bounced Off His Belly power represents projectiles getting bounced back at any ranged attackers. Note: In the event that Blob somehow had (Range) he would not strike back using his own ATK because Bounced Off His Belly’s strike back would override his normal strike back.

# Book of Vishanti
See [Marvel Required](#wiki_marvel_required_.28equipment.29)

# Break the Fourth Wall
Set: Deadpool & Friends  
This plot twist really lets you get in the game. When you put a “Me” token onto your side, you get to choose a team affiliation and your age will determine your ATK and DEF. You’ll have Leader because you’re still in charge of your team, but don’t worry – if you get KO’d you don’t lose the game because you’re also still a player. We figure you have more questions about all this, so let’s dive in. 

* **How do you prove your age?** If you’re at a tournament you’ll need an ID with a birthday. If you don’t have one, we’ll just pretend you’re 11.  

* **Does this card have different power levels for different players depending on their age?** Yes.  

* **Isn’t that ageist?** Great question. Think about it this way: Yes.  

* **What happens if I’m 29 and tomorrow’s my birthday, but then it turns to midnight in the middle of the game?** You’ll become a 3/0 and get stunned.  

* **Isn’t that kind of stupid?** Play faster next time.

* **I feel like you’re not taking this seriously.** That’s not a question.

# Bruce Banner (and the Hulk) (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
Bruce doesn’t level up. Instead, when he attacks he transforms right into the Hulk Level 2 main character. Note: Hulk doesn’t have a Level 1 version. The only way to become him is to start as Bruce.

# Buffy (MC) 
Set: The Buffy Battles  
**Save the World. A Lot.**  
Buffy’s **Save the World. A Lot.** power lets her Slay an Evil Main Character. If she does and it’s the last enemy Main Character in play, you win immediately! But if something goes wrong or there are other enemy Main Characters left, Buffy will get KO’d at the end of the turn.

# Bullseye (MC)
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**Perfect Aim**  
When Bullseye uses **Perfect Aim** it will give him ATK until it’s equal to the defender’s DEF. But if the Defender gains or loses DEF later in the combat, that won’t affect Bullseye’s ATK.

**Everything’s a Weapon**  
With **Everything’s a Weapon**, you’ll put the top card of your deck into your KO pile before you choose which enemy character to apply the effect to.

# Cable (MC)
Set: New Mutants  
**Advanced Cybernetics**  
Cable’s **Advanced Cybernetics** power gives all your equipment everywhere the (X-Men) team affiliation for a turn. This makes it so you can play any equipment even if you don’t have a character that matches the equipment’s printed team affiliation.

# Carnage
Set: The Defenders  
**Maximum Carnage**  
Carnage’s power triggers when he stuns or gets stunned. So it’s possible for it to trigger twice in one combat.

# Chameleon
Set: Sinister Syndicate  
**Master of Disguise**  
Chameleon does copy the **Sinister Six** keyword from your main characters who have that keyword. It doesn’t do anything for him in the game because he’s not a main character – he just wants to feel like a real part of the team.

# Chimichanga
Set: Deadpool & Friends  
Deadpool’s favorite deep-fried burrito has two different costs to use its super power. You must choose which cost to pay – you can’t combine them. For example, you couldn’t pay **(Energy)** and **(Intellect)** and then say Chimichanga twice. That would be madness.

# Climb
Set: Spider-Friends  
Spider-Man and many of his friends and foes are great at climbing up buildings. In the game, this lets them get an advantage before the fighting starts: At the start of your Main Phase, you may exhaust a location on your side to put a +1/+1 counter on your character with Climb. A character can only climb one location per turn and the same location can’t be climbed by more than one character. (You exhaust the location to show that it’s been climbed.) So if you have two locations but three climbers, one of them is out of luck. During your Recovery Phase your exhausted locations will ready the same time your characters do.

# Cloak 
Set: The Utopia Battles
**Darkforce Channeling**  
**Darkforce Channeling** affects all characters, including ones that appear on your side

**Shifting Loyalties**
See [Shifting Loyalties](#wiki_shifting_loyalties)

# Cosmic Cubes
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra  
Hydra has four different Cosmic Cubes under their control. However, each one has a different Super Power using a different Power Symbol.

# Cyclops (MC) 
Set: The Utopia Battles  
You will draw two cards with **They’ll Follow Him** if you have one Supporting Character that is both (Brotherhood) and (X-Men). Similarly, a multi-affiliation character can satisfy more than one of the requirements of **The Squad I’ve Put Together** and **Trust the Plan**. 

Note: **Trust the Plan** will only put three +1/+1 counters on a character even if you’re using it to satisfy two or more of the requirements. And even if you have several characters of all three required affiliations, Trust the Plan can only ever put three counters on three characters maximum.

# Dagger
Set: The Utopia Battles  
**Shifting Loyalties**
See [Shifting Loyalties](#wiki_shifting_loyalties)

# Daken
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**Pheromone Control**  
Daken’s **Pheromone Control** power takes away enemy characters’ powers while they’re in melee combat with him. This will prevent triggered powers like **Shrink** or **Berserker** from triggering in the first place.

# Daredevil
Set: The Defenders  
**Radar Sense**  
Daredevil and Rhino have effects that allow an enemy player to spend a (Skill/"Red") or (Intellect/"Yellow") to do something. In this case, they can use a Training Ground or Academy to pay for the effect, but not a special Location like Fisk Tower.

# Darkhold
See [Marvel Required](#wiki_marvel_required_.28equipment.29)

# Dawn
Set: The Buffy Battles
Dawn can’t start the game in a deck. Instead, if Buffy is your Main Character or a Supporting Character in your deck, you get to have a Key pile which includes four copies of Dawn. You can recruit Dawn while Buffy is on your side. If Dawn gets KO’d, she’ll go to your KO pile as normal.

# Devil Dinosaur
## Devil Dinosaur Team Affiliations
Set: Monsters Unleashed!  
Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur each have two different team affiliations. Moon Girl is on the Inhumans and Devil Dinosaur is on the Monsters Unleashed team.But both of them are also on the Moon Girl/Devil Dinosaur team. This allows them to Team Attack together or with members of their respective teams.(Keep in mind all members of a Team Attack must share at least one team affiliation.)

## Devil Dinosaur and Moon Girl (MCs)  
The Main Characters, Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur,go together. You start with both on your side and you’re only out of the game once both are KO’d.

# Domino
Set: The Utopia Battles   
**Probability Manipulation**  
**Probability Manipulation** requires Domino to flip a coin when she attacks or defends. If she wins the flip something good happens. Otherwise, the combat proceeds as normal.

# Dormammu
Set: MCU Villains  
**You Will Spend Eternity Dying**  
Dormammu’s **You Will Spend Eternity Dying** power allows you to wound a Main Character as many times as you’d like. For example, you could wound them twice. Or six times. Or three hundred times. Just don’t make any bargains with them.

# Dark Phoenix (SC)
Set: Crossover  \
**Deconstruct the Universe**  
Dark Phoenix When Dark Phoenix Deconstructs the Universe, an entire concept of the game gets removed for the rest of the game (even if she leaves play). If, as a result of this, the wording of a card’s power is unclear, the part that is unclear does nothing. Here’s how removing each concept works: 

* **+1/+1 and -1/-1 counters:** Remove all of those counters from the game. Remove the phrases “+1/+1 counter” and “-1/-1 counter” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause these counters to enter the game in any way 
 
* **Equipment**: Remove all Equipment cards everywhere from the game. This includes all sides, decks, hands, KO piles, and Equipment that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Equipment cards but don’t currently count as Equipment (such as a face-down resource or an Equipment that has become a character via Arnim Zola’s   
**ESP Box**). Remove the term “Equipment” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Equipment to enter the game in any way.  

* **Keyword text:** Removing this concept doesn’t affect **Flight** and **Range**. Remove all Keyword text from the game, including powers that “can’t be turned off”. Remove the term “Keyword” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Keyword text to enter the game in any way.  
 
* **Levels:** All Main Characters everywhere become Level 1 if possible. Remove all remaining Level 2 and higher Main Characters from the game. Remove all Level Up Powers and XP from the game, and the terms “Level” and “XP” from all card text. Ignore any effects that would cause XP or a Level 2 or higher Main Character to enter the game in any way.  

* **Plot Twists:** Remove all Plot Twist cards everywhere from the game. This includes all decks, hands, KO piles, and Plot Twists that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Plot Twist cards but are not currently Plot Twists (such as a face-down resource). Remove the term “Plot Twist” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause a Plot Twist to enter the game in any way.  

* **Super Powers:** Remove all Super Powers from the game. Remove the term “Super Power” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Super Powers to enter the game in any way.  



# Deadpool (MC)
Set: Deadpool & Friends
> Hiya kids, it’s your old pal, Deadpool. Guess what? I’m the First character in the game to go all the way to Level 4. There’s probably a break-the-fourth-wall joke in there somewhere, but I haven’t found it yet. Anyhoo, the powers that be want me to tell you that even though I’m now on two different main character cards, the (X-Men) and (Underworld) versions of me can’t level up into each other.  
> 
> It’s because a main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork. And guess what? I don’t mean to brag but I’m actually a designer now. You know all the cards in this set that you love? That’s right -- I designed them. (All the cards that you hate were designed by those other two dummies.) Designing stuff is sweet. You can pretty much do whatever you want.  
> 
> I like designing so much, I wanted to do some while I was in the game too. My new main character can **nerf** stuff, **errata** stuff, and even **ban** stuff. Check it out:  

**I'm Taking Over From These Idiot Designers**  
  
* **Nerf:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks, and KO piles are 0/1 with 1 and nothing can ever, ever change that.  

* **Errata:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles lose and can’t gain powers (including (*Flight*) and (*Range*)). 
 
* **Ban:** Name a character and choose a number. Put all supporting characters with that name on enemy sides into their owner’s hands. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles have a cost equal to the chosen number and nothing can ever, ever change that. (Except banning it again. You know the old saying: “If you really, really hate a card, ban it twice.”) Any effects that would increase or decrease what an enemy player pays to recruit a banned card are ignored.  

Here are some quick tips:  

* If you steal a character with one of those effects the effect will stop because it’s not an enemy character anymore. Yay! However, if it goes back to an enemy side the effect will turn on again. Boo!  

* When you Ban a character, you can name any number you want. Even a million bazillion. Try it, it’s fun!

* If someone tries to tell you that this isn’t really how nerfing, errata-ing, and banning works, you just take your katana and do some "development” on them, if you know what I mean.

# Death Trap 
Set: The Predator Battles  
While this card is face down in your Resource Row, you can play it as if it was in your hand. If you do, put it into your KO pile as normal, then replace it with the top card of your deck, face down. If you have no cards in your deck, you can still play it, you just won’t be able to replace it.

# Devil Slayer
Set: The New Defenders  
**Shadow Cloak**  
His **Shadow Cloak** lets him attack hidden and stunned characters. Treat it as a regular attack (both players can play Plot Twists, Power Up, etc.), but keep in mind the face-down character’s powers are turned off and its team affiliation is not available for things like playing a plot twist.

When Devil-Slayer and the defender strike each other: 

* Devil-Slayer can be stunned as normal.  
* A hidden character can get stunned as normal. (Wound it and change it from ready to exhausted.) 
* If Devil-Slayer’s strike would stun an already-stunned character, just wound it instead.

# Doctor Faustus
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra  
**Hypnotic Suggestion**  
Doctor’s Faustus’s Super Power allows you to steal an enemy Supporting Character. This effect is permanent: the character will remain on your side until it gets KO’d or otherwise leaves play. When KO’d, put it into its owner’s KO pile.

# Doctor Nemesis
Set: Resistance  
**Self-Evolved Intellect**  
Doctor Nemesis He only doubles the +ATK/+DEF from the Plot Twists (not the -ATK /-DEF). If the bonus from the Plot Twist is variable, like from the Plot Twist Nuhumans, calculate the variable first, then double it. Note: +1/+1 counters granted from a Plot Twist are unaffected by Dr. Nemesis.

# Edwin
Set: The Predator Battles  
Each copy of Edwin is Good until he uses **I Like it Here** (even if a previous one has become Evil). Each copy of Edwin can only use **I Like It Here** if that copy of the card has used **I Wouldn’t Do That**.

# Ego
Set: MCU Villains 
**Soon We Will Be All There Is**    
Ego’s **Soon We Will Be All There Is** power allows you to turn a face-down location in your resource row face up to become a supporting character. Once this happens it will stop being a location.

# Electro
## Electro (SC)
Set: Sinister Syndicate  
**Electrocution**  
Electro introduces a new concept: remaining health. Remaining health is a character’s (Health) maximum minus its wounds. (Maximum (Health) is printed plus any bonus .) For example, when a character with 1  printed (Health) appears, it will have 1 remaining health. If a character has 3 printed (Health) and is getting +1 (Health) from an effect and has 2 wounds, its remaining health is 2 (3 + 1 – 2 = 2).

## Elektra (MC)
Set: Legacy  
**Hand Experience**  
Elektra (main character) has a super power that allows you to hide her in your hand until your next turn starts. But if she somehow gets discarded from your hand, shuffled into your deck, or otherwise goes anywhere except into play, then you’ll lose the game at the start of your next turn.

# Emma Frost
## Emma Frost (MC) 
Set: The Utopia Battles  
**Keeper of Law**  
**Keeper of Law** allows a character to strike an additional time in a combat. The character can strike two different characters once each (if they’re being team attacked, for example), or they can strike the same character twice. In the latter case, add the character’s ATK together for each strike and then compare it to the enemy’s DEF. 

Emma’s power can be used any number of times each turn. So if a character ends up being allowed to strike 3, 4, or more times, it works as above. Any number of strikes can be combined against an enemy or split amongst multiple enemies.

## Emma Frost (SC) (HAMMER)
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**Fluid Forms and Fidelity**  
When Emma transforms via **Fluid Forms and Fidelity**, the card that used to be in play is removed from the game. When she transforms, she keeps her orientation (ready/exhausted, face-up/face-down), all of her counters, and any effects on her.

## Emma Frost (SC) (Resistance)
Set: Resistance    
**Fluid Forms and Fidelity**  
When Emma transforms via **Fluid Forms and Fidelity**, the card that used to be in play is removed from the game. When she transforms, she keeps her orientation (ready/ exhausted, face-up /face-down), all of her counters, and any effects on her.

# Evil Deadpool
Set: Deadpool & Friends   
Made from Deadpool’s discarded body parts that fused back together into a new person, Evil Deadpool gains XP whenever you discard a character. This includes powering up as well as any effect that causes you to “discard” a card (whether you or your opponent controls the effect).

**Merc With an Evil Mouth**  
Evil Deadpool loves being Evil. That’s why he can grant Evil characters on your side the new keyword, Evil Lethal. Evil Lethal works just like regular Lethal except after you KO the supporting defender you laugh evilly. (If you’re unable to laugh evilly you’ll still resolve the effect as much as possible and KO the defender.)  

**It's Like You, But Eviler!**  
Evil Deadpool’s Level 2 super power puts Good characters into play but turns them Evil and adds the word “Evil” at the beginning of their name. Changing their name DOES affect the uniqueness rules. For example, it would allow you to have “Iron Man” and “Evil Iron Man” on your side at the same time. However, you would not be able to add “Evil” to regular Deadpool because then his name would be “Evil Deadpool” which is the same name as your main character. And Evil Deadpool hates Deadpool anyway.

# Facehugger
Set: The Alien Battles  
**Facehuggers and Capturing Characters**   
If you have Ovomorphs in your deck (the eggs that make Facehuggers), you’ll use the Facehugger Pile. 

* The Facehugger Pile includes three Facehugger token characters and one Extended Incubation card. These cards start the game out of play. (If more than one player is using Ovomorphs, they will each use their own Facehugger Pile.)   
* When an Ovomorph is ready to Hatch, reveal a random card from your Facehugger Pile.  
* If you reveal the Extended Incubation card, the Ovomorph doesn’t open yet. Shuffle the Extended Incubation card back into your Facehugger Pile.  
* If you reveal a Facehugger token character, KO its Ovomorph, put the Facehugger into your Back Row, and it captures an enemy supporting character. (It can capture a face-up or stunned supporting character.)  

“Capture” is a new game action that means:  
* Remove the Captive card from the game, but keep any wound counters on it.  
* Put the Captive card next to (or underneath) its Captor to make it clear who its Captor is.  
* When the Captor leaves play, put its Captive back into play stunned in its owner’s back row.  
* You may pay an (Alien/"Space") at the start of your Build Phase. If you do, KO the Facehugger and put its captive into its owner’s KO pile. Then you may put an (Xenomorph) character from your hand into your back row. (This represents the new Xenomorph bursting out of the captive’s chest.)  
* Note: Put the KO’d Facehugger token back into your Facehugger Pile.

# Faith 
Set: The Buffy Battles  
Faith can steal any kind of counter from an enemy defender.

# Falcon
Set: The MCU Battles  
**Air Superiority**  
Falcon’s **Air Superiority** power prevents characters with from striking him. It doesn’t matter if that character is attacking or defending, or if it’s a melee or ranged attack. As long as it has it can’t strike him.

# Falcon Drone
Set: The Predator Battles  
**Bond**  
Some characters have a **Bond** with another character. This allows them to be discarded from your hand to generate a Power Symbol for that other character’s Super Powers. You can do this for that character’s Main or Supporting Character. 

Example: You want to use the Falconer Supporting Character’s **Bait and Switch** Super Power, which costs (Skill/"Red"). You may discard a Falcon Drone from your hand to pay for the Super Power. If a character with Bond is used to generate a Power Symbol for a Super Power with Amplify, the Amplify text will apply

# Falconer (MC) 
Set: The Predator Battles  
**Active Falcon Drone**  
Falconer starts the game with a Falcon Drone from your deck on his side. The Falcon Drone still counts toward your 60 cards when you build your deck. 

**We're the Game**  
His Level Up Power, **We’re the Game**, triggers whenever an enemy player reveals one or more cards. Some effects that would grant 1 XP this way are when a player reveals their hand, when a player reveals one or more cards from the top of their deck, or when a player reveals the cards they draw (due to a Falcon Drone).

# Fin Fang Foom
Set: Monsters Unleashed!  
Fin Fang Foom and Leviathon Hydra are each able to attack multiple enemies at once. When they do, they will strike with their full ATK against each defender, and the defenders will total up their ATK to strike back.

# The First Evil (MC) 
Set: The Buffy Battles  
If two or more players are playing as The First Evil, they will need to randomly determine who chooses which one takes the first turn.

# Gambit
## Gambit (MC)
Set: Resistance  
**'Dis Card**  
Note that discarding a card includes Power Ups. So each time any character on your side Powers Up, Gambit will gain an XP.

## Gambit (SC)
Set: Resistance  
**Molecular Acceleration**  
**Molecular Acceleration** is a Keyword Power, not a Super Power.

# The Gentlemen 
Set: The Buffy Battles  
**Hush**  
**Hush** prevents players from using effects that require you to “say” something or to “name” something. **Hush** also prevents players from talking. You can still communicate in other ways such as using hand signals, or writing things down. You can also make sounds without using your vocal chords. If a player does speak, do your best impersonation of a Gentleman in order to shush them. (There is no in-game penalty for speaking. It’s just not cool.)

# Glory 
Set: The Buffy Battles  
**Drain Sanity**  
**Drain Sanity** gets more powerful each time you use it, even if you use it on two (or more) different copies of Glory

# Goblin Queen
Set: A-Force  
**Token Characters**  
Goblin Queen has the power to make token characters. A token character works just like a regular character except that if it ever gets put into a KO pile or otherwise leaves play, remove it from the game.

# Gorgon
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra  
**The Spear in the East**  
Gorgon’s power removes the stat benefit from +1/+1 counters on enemy characters. They still count as having the counters though. For example, if an enemy character with two +1/+1 counters gains a -1/-1 counter, you’ll still remove one of each counter type.

# Green Goblin (MC)
Set: Crossover  
The Sinister Six have gained two new Main Characters to choose from. Remember, when you build a Sinister Six deck, you choose any six Sinister Six characters to go with that deck.

**Bag of Tricks**  
Goblin’s Bag of Tricks allows you to discard Locations to make him more powerful in combat. If this causes Goblin to strike “before each other character,” this means he strikes first even if any of the characters have, for example, a power like Ferocious. And if two Goblins are in combat with that ability, they’ll strike each other at the same time. If you discard an Oscorp Location, it’s like a wild: you can treat it as though it’s any of the other four Locations that you didn’t already discard this combat.

# Headsman
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**Executioner**  
**Ferocious** means – While in melee combat, Headsman strikes before characters without Ferocious.

# Hulk
## Hulk (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
See [Bruce Banner](#wiki_bruce_banner_.28and_the_hulk.29_.28mc.29)

## Hulk (SC - Photo)
Set: The MCU Battles  
**Hulk Like Raging Fire**  
Hulk’s **Hulk Like Raging Fire** power allows you to choose any number to give him that much ATK and DEF during combat. “Any number” means any whole number. Some popular examples are 7, 15, 211, 45,000, 100,000,000, and 9.

## Hulk (SC - Illustrated)
Set: The New Defenders  
**Puny Weapons Can’t Hurt Hulk**  
Hulk’s **Puny Weapons Can’t Hurt Hulk** power means that Lethal wounds (and even Evil Lethal wounds) won’t KO him. This also includes, but is not limited to, things like Gamora’s Godslayer Blade and MCU Drax’s Finger on Throat Means Death.

# Impersonating Powers
Set: Utopia Battles   
Several characters have powers that impersonate other characters. These powers turn off immediately if the character they’re impersonating ever shows up. It doesn’t matter if the character that’s being impersonated is face up or face down or what side they’re on. Either way they count as being on “a side” and will turn off the Impersonation power.

# Ironheart
Set: Crossover  
**We’re All Weirdos Here**  
**We’re All Weirdos Here** lets your Supporting Characters Team Attack even if they don’t share a team affiliation and even if they’re in different rows. If there’s at least one melee attacker and at least one ranged attacker in the same attack, then the attack itself is both a melee and a ranged attack. Note: Each character must still legally be able to attack the defender.

# Iron Monger (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
The owner of a character is the player who brought that card to the game, regardless of which side that character is currently on. So Iron Monger’s **Steal Idea** power will trigger when a character that an enemy player “owns” gets recruited, whether that enemy player recruited it themselves or if you used Iron Monger’s **You Had a Great Idea, Tony** power.

# Isabelle
Set: The Predator Battles  
**Sniper Nest**   
Isabelle’s supporting character has this keyword. Enemy players can turn down any Location with an (Energy/"Blue"), including their “wild” Location, to turn off this effect for a turn.


# Jessica Jones
Set: Legacy  
**Psionic Protection**  
This power refers to (Intellect/Light bulb) super powers.
This counts for any super power with the appropriate
symbol in its cost (even if it also has other symbols in
its cost).


# Juggernaut (MC)
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**It’s Gonna Take Something More to Stop Me!**  
Juggernaut is so big and powerful it’s almost impossible to beat him physically. Fortunately (for his enemies) he’s vulnerable to other kinds of attacks. This is represented on his card by his **It’s Gonna Take Something More to Stop Me!** power, which allows enemy players to spend an *Energy* ("Atom"/"Blue") to weaken him. Note: This works just like any other super power – except an enemy player can only use it once per turn during their Main Phase. And keep in mind special locations like Avengers Mansion can’t be used by an opponent on Juggernaut’s power.

# Kaecilius
Set: MCU Villains  
 **Fold Space and Matter**  
Kaecilius’s **Fold Space and Matter** power adds a new rule to Vs. System® 2PCG®: an exhausted resource doesn’t produce recruit points. You can still use an exhausted location to pay for a super power.

# The Kingpin (SC)
Set: The Defenders  
**Underworld Boss**  
The Kingpin Supporting Character has a Super Power where he takes over as your main character. When this happens, your former Main Character becomes a Supporting Character and remains in the game. It can still gain XP and Level Up, but you don’t lose the game if it gets KO’d. Instead, you now lose the game when Kingpin gets KO’d.

# Kraven the Hunter (MC)
Set: Sinister Syndicate  
** Spring the Trap **  
Kraven has a Reaction super power. These types of super powers work a little differently than normal super powers. Reaction powers trigger when a certain condition is met (in Kraven’s case, it’s “when an enemy supporting character appears”). When that happens you can pay a (Skill/"Red"), and if you do, you put three -1/-1 counters on that character. You can use a Reaction super power at any time, as long as its trigger condition is met. However, like other super powers, you can only use it once per turn.

# Lambert
Set: The Predator Battles  
**No Autographs**   
While in play, Lambert has every Good Team Affiliation. This does a variety of things. For example, he can team attack with any other Good characters, and while he is face up, he helps you play any Good Plot Twists.

# Leviathon Hydra
Set: Monsters Unleashed!  
See [Fin Fang Foom](#wiki_fin_fang_foom).

# Life on the Hellmouth 
Set: The Buffy Battles  
This Plot Twist puts two characters on your side in a Relationship. This means they can team attack together (even if they’re not on the same team), and while doing so they can’t be struck back by a defender. Once a character in a Relationship leaves play, the Relationship is over.

# Loki (SC)
The MCU Battles  
**I Am Burdened With Glorious Purpose**  
Loki’s **I Am Burdened With Glorious Purpose** power lets you discard a character from your hand to increase the stats of a character in combat. Loki himself doesn’t have to be in combat to use this power.

# Magik 
Set: New Mutants  
**Summon Soulsword**  
Magik’s **Summon Soulsword** power introduces Equipment tokens to the game. An Equipment token works just like a regular Equipment while it’s in play. But if it ever leaves play, remove it from the game (the same way you would remove a character token).

# Magneto (MC)
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
In this set Magneto gets a whole new main character card, and this time  it goes to Level 3. This card represents Magneto’s desire to bring all mutants together as one. (Note: The version of Magneto can’t level up into the version of him and vice versa. A main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork as it does.)

# Mandarin
Set: The MCU Battles  
Mandarin is really three potential characters in one. If Mandarin is in your deck you’ll need to bring your **Behind the Camera** pile with you which includes two copies of **Trevor Slattery** and one copy of **The Ten Rings**. When Mandarin gets KO’d, you’ll remove him from the game, shuffle your Behind the Camera pile, and randomly put one of the three cards there into your hand. 

This represents who Mandarin really is – lowly actor or deadly warlord. Leave the Behind the Camera pile face down – it’s important that your opponent doesn’t find out who the Mandarin really is until you’re ready to show them.

# Marvel Required (Equipment)
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs Hydra    
This set includes four One of a Kind equipment cards – The Nullifier, Book of Vishanti, Darkhold, and Serpent Crown. Each of these has the (Marvel) symbol on its top right instead of a team affiliation. This means in order to play one, you must have a face-up (Marvel) character on your side. (The Marvel symbol is on the bottom of
Marvel character cards.)

# Mary Walker
Set: The Defenders  
Each version of Mary Walker has a different text box and ATK and DEF, but they all count as Mary Walker and can be used to Power-Up each other. Each Mary has the “One of a Kind” keyword which means you can only have one of that Mary in your deck.

# Masacre
Set: Deadpool & Friends  
Masacre es el Deadpool de México, por eso el texto de su juego está escrito en español. No te preocupes. Si no hablas español, traduciremos sus poderes aquí. Él tiene **Mercenario** lo que significa “**Mercenary**,” y **Letal** lo que significa “**Lethal**.”


# Maximus
Set: Crossover  
**Usurp the Throne**  
**Usurp the Throne** lets Maximus KO another player’s Main Character and take over being that player’s Main Character. However, if they don’t currently have a Main Character, Usurp the Throne won’t do anything.

# Mimic (MC)
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**Absorption History**  
Mimic’s **Absorption History** represents three characters that he’s copied powers from. In game terms it’s a pile that includes exactly three Main Character cards, one Level 1, one Level 2, and one Level 3. They can only be from the Illustrated Universe and they must have three different names (they can’t share a name through AKA). For example, you could have Cyclops Level 1, Dutch Level 2, and Spider-Man Level 3.

During setup when you reveal Mimic as your Main Character, you’ll also reveal the Level 1 character in your Absorption History. Mimic gains its Keyword and Super Powers only when the game begins. When Mimic becomes Level 2, you’ll reveal the Level 2 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Powers and loses the powers of the Level 1 character he was previously copying.

When Mimic becomes Level 3, you’ll reveal the Level 3 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Powers and loses the powers of the Level 2 character he was previously copying.

**Note:** While **Absorption History** is a Keyword and can technically be turned off by certain effects, turning it off doesn’t affect Mimic’s ability to use the pile (it’s locked in from the beginning of the game).

# Mirage
Set: New Mutants   
**Create Illusion**  
Mirage’s **Create Illusion** power lets you put a basic location from your hand into your resource row. Note that the new resource won’t generate any recruit points on the turn it appears. This is because recruit points are only generated at the start of your Recruit Step, which happens before you can recruit characters like Mirage.

# Mister Sinister
Set: Legacy  
**Genetic Manipulation**  
This power grants a Keyword power to a character. Unlike most effects, which only last for a turn or two, this effect lasts until the character leaves play./

# Mister X
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**I Can Predict Your Every Move**  
**I Can Predict Your Every Move** can temporarily reduce the ATK/DEF of a character while in solo combat with Mister X.For example, if a character with a printed ATK/DEF of 4/4 has three +1/+1 counters it is
currently 7/7. However, while in solo combat with Mister X, itsATK/DEF counts as 4/4.

# Moon Girl
Set: Monsters Unleashed!  
See [Devil Dinosaur](#wiki_devil_dinosaur).

# Morgan Le Fay
Set: A-Force  
**Growing Magic**  
Morgan le Fay’s super power counts how many times you’ve used a power named Growing Magic this game. This means that if you use the power a few times on one card and then later use it on a different card, all of those usages count.

# Mr. Black
Set: The Predator Battles  
**Enhanced Bio-Mask** 
Mr. Black’s super power allows him to attack a face-down (hidden or stunned) character. Treat it as a regular attack (both players can play Plot Twists, Power-Up, etc.), but keep in mind the face-down character’s powers are turned off and its Team Affiliation is not available for things like playing a Plot Twist. 

When Mr. Black and the defender strike each other: 
* Mr. Black can get stunned as normal.  
* A hidden character can get stunned as normal. (Wound it and change its orientation from ready to exhausted.)  
* If Mr. Black’s strike would stun an already-stunned character, wound it instead. Note: A stunned character can’t be stunned (including by having its DEF reduced to 0 or a direct “stun” effect).

# Mysterio
## Mysterio (MC)
Set: Sinister Syndicate  
**Hallucinogenic Gas**  
Mysterio can use his special effects expertise to make any plot twist seem like a (Sinister Syndicate) plot twist. Here are the two in this set:

* Putting the Team Together  
* Sinister Six

When you play a plot twist as a copy of a (Sinister Syndicate) plot twist, ignore everything that’s printed on it, and pretend you just played one of the (Sinister Syndicate) plot twists. You can use any plot twist this way, regardless of its printed team affiliation or timing restriction. For example, you could play an (Avengers) **Combat** plot twist during your Build Phase as a copy of Putting the Team Together.

## Mysterio (SC)
Set: Sinister Syndicate  
**Holographic Projector**  
Plot twists without team affiliations can be played  regardless of the team affiliations you have on face-up characters on your side. So Mysterio’s power means you can play any plot twist in your hand even if you only have, say, (Sinister Syndicate) characters on your side.

# Mystique (MC)
Set: Legacy  
**Identity Theft**  
Mystique’s super power allows her to transform into a different Level 2 Main Character. When she does this, remove her from the game and put the new character into play in the same orientation (ready/exhausted) she was in. Move all counters from her onto the new character, applying any effects (such as Freeze) to the new character. 

Playing with friends, you can choose to transform into any character in your collection, but if you’re playing in a tournament, you must select three Main Character options when you build your deck. You must set them face-down next to your unused Level 2/Level 3 characters. (You don’t need to show them to your opponent.)

# Namor (MC)
Set: The New Defenders  
Namor All three of Namor’s **Rage** powers DO count face-down exhausted enemy characters as well. Likewise, his two **Level Up** powers also DO count facedown exhausted enemy characters as well.

**Atlantis Rises**  
**Atlantis Rises** adds a new row to your side, between your back row and your resource row, for the rest of the game. A player can’t have more than one Atlantis row on their side. Atlantis works just like your front and back rows (you can move characters there during your Formation Step, for example) with the following exceptions: 

* Characters in Atlantis can’t attack.  
* They are ‘protected’ by faceup characters in your front row and back row.  
* They can’t be attacked unless each character in your front and back rows is face down.

# Nebula
Set: The MCU Battles  
**Rivalry**  
Nebula’s **Rivalry** power requires you name a character. You can name any character, including one that isn’t in play.

# New Mutants
Set: New Mutants  
The New Mutants are a part of the (X-Men) team. However, there are certain effects that reference “New Mutants” specifically, which means they have a card number that begins with “NEW”.

# Nick Fury (MC)
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra  
**Infinity Formula**  
Nick Fury has a Super Power which keeps him alive. But once you use the power the first time, you must continue using it on each of your successive turns. Otherwise Fury will get KO’d.

# Norman Osborn (MC) 
Set: The Utopia Battles  
Norman’s Level 2 Keyword Powers also affect himself. 

Note: Dark Avengers, Dark X-Men does not give your (Avengers) and (X-Men) characters the (HAMMER) team affiliation

# The Nullifier
See [Marvel Required](#wiki_marvel_required_.28equipment.29)

# Omega Machine Components 
These are four different One of a Kind Equipment that have the same name. Unlike characters, Equipment are not unique so you can have any number with same name in play at the same time. Because these have the (Hammer) symbol, you must have a face-up character with in order to play them.

See also: [Machine](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_machine)

# Omega Red
Set: Crossover  
**Carbonadium Tentacles**  
The phrase “could melee attack” means Omega Red can legally attack that character(s) right now. Normally this just means he must be ready and the character(s) must be unprotected.

# Onslaught
Set: Legacy  
**Joint Consciousness**  
Onslaught’s power occurs when you pay to recruit him, but before he appears. This way he will trigger any “appears” powers on cards he removed from the game.

# Oz
Set: The Buffy Battles  
**Lose Control**   
**Lose Control** lets an enemy player force Oz to strike another Supporting Character. If Oz’s ATK is greater than or equal to that character’s DEF, Oz stuns that character.

# Phil Coulson
## Phil Coulson (Illustrated)
Set: Crossover  
**Special Agent**  
Coulson’s **Special Agent** power means when a character with Agent appears on your side, you’ll get to look one card deeper into your deck.

**Level 7 Clearance / I'm a Guy With a Plan**  
His **Level 7 Clearance** and **I’m A Guy With a Plan** count each instance of **Agent** on a character, so FitzSimmons will count as two Agents. And **I’m a Guy With a Plan** will count Coulson himself.

## Phil Coulson (Photo)
Set: MCU heroes  
**They Need Someone to Avenge**  
Phil’s They Need Someone to Avenge power is not optional. If he’s in your KO pile at the start of your Main Phase, you must remove him from the game and then you can put +1/+1 counters on your characters.

# Pixie (MC)
Set: The Utopia Battles  
**Souldagger** 
**Souldagger** causes a character to lose each modifier it gained during combat. A modifier is an effect that modifies the game. There are two types of modifiers – 

A one-shot modifier does something immediately and then is done. Example: “Put two +1/+1 counters on a character.”

 A continuous modifier has an ongoing effect on the game, which may or may not have a duration. Example: “Choose a character to get +2/+0 and **Lethal** this combat.” 
 
When Pixie uses **Souldagger**, it will cause an enemy character to lose any continuous modifiers that are applying to it. (It won’t stop any one-shot modifiers because it’s impossible for there to be any one-shot modifiers happening while you use **Souldagger**.) 

**Half-Fairy**  
**Half-Fairy** will give Pixie an XP when any character (including an enemy) pays an (Energy/"Blue"). This includes when a character uses an (Engergy/"Blue") Super Power, or choosing to spend an (Energy/"Blue") when you play the Plot Twist **Sacred Ground**.

# Power Man
Set: The New Defenders  
Some characters are known by more than one moniker - like Power Man, who says **AKA Luke Cage**. He counts as having both names, which means you can use a Luke Cage supporting character to Power Up Power Man, and vice versa. It also means they both count as the same person for the purposes of the Uniqueness rules.

**Crash the Party**  
Power Man loves a good party, especially if he wasn’t invited. His Crash the Party power counts each enemy power, even if there are multiple instances of the same power. But remember face-down characters lose their powers so he won’t count their powers.

# Professor X (MC)
Set: New Mutants  
In this set the Professor gets a whole new main character, and this time he goes up to Level 3. (Note: This new Professor X can’t level up into the old one from The Marvel Battles set and vice versa. A main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork as it does.) 

**Graduation**   
Professor X’s **Graduation** power lets you turn an (X-Men) supporting character into the main character version of that character. (Once it’s become a main character it can level up normally. Professor X is a really good teacher.)

This allows you to have any number of main characters in play at once. However, Professor X is still your MAIN main character – if he gets KO’d you’ll lose the game. (Your other main characters getting KO’d won’t cause you to lose the game.)

# Pyro
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**Fire Manipulation**  
Pyro’s Fire Manipulation power lets him create a supporting character creature that has the stats of a random character from your deck. The new character uses a physical supporting character card but erases its name, team affiliation, and game text and powers and replaces them with the name Fire Man, the (Brotherhood) team symbol, and the Creature keyword. (Which means it can’t have equipment.) When it’s KO’d or otherwise leaves play the card will go back to counting as the character printed on it.

# Rhino
## Rhino (Sinister Syndicate)
Set: Crossover  
**Headlong Charge**  
Rhino “Sidestep” means that the defender stays where it is, but avoids Rhino just enough. The defender doesn’t count as moving. When an enemy front row character sidesteps, you’ll get to pick a new defender in their back row. If there aren’t any, the combat will end. Sorry Rhino!

## Rhino (Underworld)
Set: The Defenders  
Daredevil and Rhino have effects that allow an enemy player to spend a (Skill/"Red") or (Intellect/"Yellow") to do something. In this case, they can use a Training Ground or Academy to pay for the effect, but not a special Location like Fisk Tower.

# Rocket
Set: The MCU Battles  
**I’m Gonna Need a Few Things**  
Rocket’s **I’m Gonna Need a Few Things** power requires you to choose two cards with different names in your KO pile. If you don’t have two cards with two different names, his power will have no effect.

# Rogue
## Rogue (MC)
Set: Resistance
Note that if she Powers Up while Level 1 or 2, Rogue will gain an XP. Also, her **Force Transfer** and **Life Transfer** will each give her 2 XP when they are used.

## Rogue (SC)
Set: A-Force  
**Absorb Powers**  
Rogue has the ability to gain the keyword and super powers of supporting characters she’s KO’d. When she does this, if that character’s power refers to its own name, use Rogue’s name instead.

# Royce
Set: The Predator Battles  
**We’re Going to Kill Them All**  
Royce’s supporting character has this Super Power. It allows him to move a wound from an enemy character (even an enemy Main Character) to an enemy Supporting Character. The characters must be different. The first character counts as being healed and the second character counts as being wounded.

# Sacred Ground 
Set: The Utopia Battles  
This Plot Twist lets a character pay any power symbol. You can generate a power symbol in the usual ways -- by turning a Location that makes a power symbol face down, or by discarding a Location that makes a power symbol.

# Sauron
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**Terrifying Delusions**  
Sauron’s **Terrifying Delusions** power tricks a main character into striking a supporting character on their side. When this happens compare the main character’s ATK to the supporting character’s DEF to see if it gets stunned. This doesn’t count as a combat and there will be no strike back.

# Scarlet Spider
## Scarlet Spider (MC)
Set: Spider-Friends  
Before he was the Scarlet Spider, the man who would become Ben Reilly was created from Peter Parker’s DNA to be a perfect clone. So in the game he actually starts off as a different “Spider” hero until his true self is revealed (once he reaches Level 2). Here’s how it works: 

Your Spider Web is a new out-of-play pile that includes up to one copy of every other Level 1 main character with “Spider” in its name. (Currently this includes Spider-Man from The Marvel Battles expansion, *Spider-Man* from Monsters Unleashed, and Spider-Man and Spider-Woman from this Issue.) 

Your Clone Pile is another out-of-play pile. It starts empty but during the game you’ll put characters from your Spider Web into it. 

Before the game begins, when each player reveals their main character, you’ll reveal the Scarlet Spider. Then instead of putting him on your side during setup, you’ll put a character from your Spider Web onto your side. 

When that character would become Level 2, you’ll instead transform it into Level 2 Scarlet Spider. (It will keep its counters, any effects on it, and its ready/exhausted and face-up/facedown orientation.) Then put the Level 1 main character he started the game as and the Level 1 Scarlet Spider main character into your Clone Pile. 

Once he’s Level 2, if he would be wounded, there’s a chance it was just a clone body instead: reveal a random card from your Clone Pile. If you reveal Scarlet Spider, he’ll get wounded as normal – they found you! But if you reveal someone else, he doesn’t get wounded (although whoever was revealed goes back into your Spider Web.)

## Scarlet Spider (SC)
Set: Spider-Friends  
**Paralytic Darts**  
Scarlet Spider Scarlet Spider’s **Paralytic Darts** cause an enemy character to become immobilized indefinitely. This effect lasts even after Scarlet Spider leaves play. (It will end once the immobilized character leaves play.)

# Scarlet Witch
Set: The Defenders  
**Hex**  
Scarlet Witch’s **Hex** power prevents enemy Main Characters from Leveling Up. They can still gain XP up to their Level Up number, but not beyond. And once Scarlet Witch gets stunned or leaves play, if they have enough XP, they’ll immediately Level Up.

# Scourge
Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
**Betsy’s Incendiary Missiles**  
**Betsy’s Incendiary Missiles** lets you **Burn** a character. This means “At the end of each of your turns, stun that character.” A Burn effect has no set duration – it will last until the burning characterleaves play.

# Sentry
Set: The Utopia Battles  
**Reluctant God**  
**Reluctant God** prevents Sentry from striking, but he can still attack.

# Serpent Crown
See [Marvel Required](#wiki_marvel_required_.28equipment.29)

# Shadow King
Set: Brotherhood of Mutants  
**Anchor Host**  
Shadow King is technically a supporting character but he doesn’t want to actually be in play. He prefers to have a physical host. If he would appear for any reason, you’ll remove him from the game instead and choose a face-up character on your side to be his Host. If you don’t have a face-up character, Shadow King will still be removed from the game. When his Host gets stunned or leaves play Shadow King will remain removed from the game

# She-Hulk (MC)
Set: A-Force  
**Rules Lawyer**  
She-Hulk’s main character introduces a new kind of super power called a **Reaction**. It reads: 

> Reaction : When an enemy player uses a super power, you may say “Objection!” If you do, cancel that super power.

Reaction powers trigger when a certain condition is met (in this case it’s “When an enemy player uses a super power”). When that happens you can pay an (and say “Objection” of course) and if you do it cancels the super power so it never takes effect.

You can use a Reaction power at any time, as long as its trigger condition is met. However, like other super powers, you can only use it once per turn.

# Shifting Loyalties 
Set: The Utopia battles  
At the end of your turn, if there is an enemy (Brotherhood), (Resistance), or (X-Men) character on more than one side, Shifting Loyalties will trigger once for each side. First you’ll get to choose which side your character moves to. Once there it will lose its (HAMMER) affiliation, so the remaining times **Shifting Loyalties** had triggered won’t do anything.

See also: [Cloak](#wiki_cloak) and [Dagger](#wiki_dagger)

# Sif
Set: Crossover  
You can only recruit her by also paying a Might *(Fist/Green)*. If you don’t have one to pay, you can’t recruit her. Note: If she appears somehow without getting recruited, you don’t have to pay a Might *(Fist/Green)*.

# Simon Trask (MC) 
Set: The Utopia Battles  
**Proposition X**  
**Proposition X** works like this. When an enemy character appears, check each of its team affiliations against each team affiliation on characters on your side. For each affiliation the enemy character has that is NOT shared, Trask gains 1 XP. 

**Biosentinel**  
**Biosentinel** is a keyword power that has no built-in effect. Instead it is referenced by Trask’s other powers.

# Sinister Six 
Set: Sinister Syndicate  
If you’re playing with the Sinister Six, you actually have six main characters instead of one. Here’s how it works: When you build a Sinister Six deck, choose six main characters with **Sinister Six** to make up your Sinister Six Pile.

Before the game begins, when each player reveals their main character, you’ll reveal each main character in your Sinister Six Pile. Then when you would put your main character on your side during setup, choose any character in your Sinister Six Pile and put it on your side. 

During the game, when your Sinister Six main character gets KO’d remove it from the game but you don’t lose the game – unless your Sinister Six Pile is empty. At the start of your next turn, choose one of the remaining characters in your Sinister Six Pile and put it onto your side. 

The **Sinister Six** keyword can’t be turned off.

Keep in mind when choosing your next Sinister Six main character, you can choose one with the same name as a supporting character on your side – but if you do, that supporting character will be KO’d.

# Soldiers
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra  
Several (Hydra) characters have the new **Soldier** Keyword Power, which allows them to work together to take out an enemy. When a Soldier appears, put -1/-1 counters equal to the number of Soldiers on your side onto an unprotected enemy Supporting Character. The more Soldiers you have, the better they’ll be at hurting an enemy.

Set: Crossover Vol. 2
Even though its name is spelled differently it still counts as being "Spider" for the purpose of powers that reference the word "Spider", such as * Spider-Man *' s **Spider-People**. It's just how they spell in the future!

SP//dr must not have any wounds at the start of your turn in order for its **Genius** power to trigger. So even if **Regeneration** heals SP//dr's last wound, you won't get to draw from **Genius** that turn.

# Spider-Gwen
Set: Legacy  
**Dimensional Wristwatch**  
Spider-Gwen can be recruited while she’s in your deck. To do so, announce that you’re recruiting her, then search your deck for her, shuffle your deck, and then pay to recruit her. (Note: You may only announce that you are recruiting her if she actually is in your deck.)

# Spider-Man
## Spider-Man (MC)
Set: Spider-Friends  
**I Can and Will Fight You**
This issue introduces the powerful Alien Symbiote version of Spider-Man. But as they say, with great alien power comes great alien… danger. While the symbiote does make him stronger, he must remove it or it will quickly be game over. In the comics, when Spider-Man fights off the symbiote, it splits off from him as a separate entity. In the game, when Spider-Man sheds the symbiote, it splits off from him as a separate card. When this happens, Spider-Man will become Level 2 and now wears a cloth version of his black costume and the Alien Symbiote will look for a new host. (Note: Spider-Man Level 2 has one less Health – this represents losing the strength of the symbiote.) 

When a character with the Alien Symbiote is turned face down but isn’t KO’d, just keep the equipment token face up and ready, just like when it’s equipped to a face-up character (it doesn’t exhaust or turn face down). And remember, the symbiote is a jealous entity – it can’t be destroyed or removed from its host (at least until the host leaves play).

## Spider-Man (SC)
Set: Spider-Friends  
**Spider-Powers**  
Spider-Man’s **Spider-Powers** do not have a limited duration. Any new keywords he gains will last until he leaves play.

# * Spider-Man *
Set: Crossover Vol. 2  
**Citizen of the Multiverse**  
Miles Morales doesn't technically have the **Spider-Verse** keyword, but he likes to hang out with his multiversal friends. * Spider Man *'s **Citizen of the Multiverse** means your deck may include up to four different **Spider-Verse** Main Characters. 

These characters **do** count toward your total of 60 cards in your deck. If * Spider-Man * gets KO'd, you're not out of the game if you ahve at least one of your other Main Characters on your side.

# Spider-Man Noir
Set: Crossover Vol. 2  
**Black and White**  
**Black and White** prevents enemy Locations from pro
# Squirrel Girl
Set: Legacy  
**Let’s Get Nuts**  
Squirrel Girl’s power lets her put token characters into play. A token character works just like a regular character except that if it ever gets put into a KO pile or otherwise leaves play, it ceases to exist. The token card can be reused later if Squirrel Girl appears again.

# Stand Together
Set: Crossover  
**Stand Together** introduces **Reaction** Plot Twists to the game. When an enemy character uses a Super Power, after they pay any required power symbols, you can play **Stand Together** to cancel it before it takes effect. You must have at least as many face-up characters as the number of power symbols they paid. (If they paid none, then you don’t have to have any face-up characters.)

# Star Lord
## Star Lord (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
**Dance Off, Bro**  
Star-Lord (Main Character) Star-Lord’s Level Up power lets you start a Dance Off. Starting with you, each player may exhaust one of their ready characters or they’re out of the Dance Off. Repeat this process until only one player is left. They’re the winner.

## Star Lord (SC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
**Half Celestial**  
Star-Lord’s **Half Celestial** power prevents him from being KO’d as long as you have a face-up main character on your side. However, if Star-Lord has fatal wounds and your main character gets turned face down, Star-Lord will immediately become KO’d.

# Storm
Set: Resistance  
**You Can’t Weather This Storm**  
**You Can’t Weather This Storm** is a Keyword Power, not a Super Power.

# Sunspot
Set: New Mutants   
**Solar Absorption**  
Sunspot’s **Solar Absorption** power is not optional. At the start of your Main Phase, you must turn a basic location face down, even if you’re the only player with one.

# Supreme Leader
Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra  
**Hydra High Council**   
Supreme Leader has a Super Power which prevents you from losing the game even after he’s KO’d. Just continue to play without a main character.

# Sweet
Set: The Buffy Battles  
**That's Entertainment**   
**That’s Entertainment** moves each face-up character to their front row and has them perform a Musical Number. There is no official definition of what counts as a Musical Number. We recommend rocking the cards back and forth and having them sing a song. (Although if The Gentlemen are in play, no singing is allowed.)

# Thor (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
**Journey of Self Discovery**  
Thor’s **Journey of Self Discovery** Level Up power requires him to make three separate attacks in the order printed on his card to gain an XP. These attacks don’t have to be in a row. For example, he could make a solo attack, then a team attack with one teammate, then another solo attack, and finally when he team attacks with exactly two other characters he’ll gain an XP.

# Titania
Set: A-Force  
**Durable**  
Titania has the new **Durable** keyword. This means if she gets stunned in some way that isn’t getting struck in combat, she recovers and doesn’t get wounded. 

However, if she was in the middle of combat when she got stunned (perhaps by Sin’s super power), even though she would recover immediately, getting stunned would still remove her from combat.

# Toad 
Set: Resistance  
**Toadally Awesome**  
Remember, Toad isn’t just Sort of Awesome.

# Tracker
Set: The Predator Battles  
**It Wants Us to Run**   
Tracker has a keyword that says: “Tracker has +1/+1 for each different basic Location type on all sides.” There are six basic Location types, one for each Power Symbol (even though there are more than six different names for these six types): (Humanity/"Earth"), (Alien/"Space"), (Energy/"Blue"), (Intellect/"Yellow"), (Skill/"Red"), and (Might/"Green").

# Trance 
Set: Resistance  
**Astral Form Overload**  
When she has an **Astral Form Overload**, she gains **Stealth** and **Fearless**. **Stealth** means she can melee attack back row characters, even while they’re protected. **Fearless** means that she strikes Main Characters with double her ATK.

# Ultron Facility (MC)
Set: The MCU Battles  
Ultron is really six main characters in one: three identical Level 1s, two identical Level 2s, and one Level 3. Before the game starts you’ll put one Level 1 Ultron onto your side. The remaining five Ultron cards will start out of play in a face-up pile called your **Ultron Facility**. 

During the game you can use any Ultron’s **There’s Only One Path To Peace** power to put the lowest level Ultron from your Ultron Facility onto your side. When one of your Ultron main 27 characters gets KO’d it goes back to your Ultron Facility where it will be available to be brought back again.

If all your Ultrons are in the Ultron Facility at the same time, you lose the game. 

**Note:** The Level 3 Ultron’s **Your Extinction** power KOs all enemy cards (in a very dramatic way).


# Venom (MC)
Set: Crossover  
The Sinister Six have gained two new Main Characters to choose from. Remember, when you build a **Sinister Six** deck, you choose any six Sinister Six characters to go with that deck.

**Relentless Bond**  
Venom’s **Relentless Bond** will put a +1/+1 counter on him whether or not he’s stunned.

# Vocal Mimicry
Set: The Predator Battles  
Currently, there are only 3 (Predator) One of a Kind Plot Twists that it can copy: “Any Time.”, “Over Here.” and “Turn Around.”

# Vulture
Set: Sinister Syndicate  
**From Above**  
While Vulture is attacking a character without (Flight) that is also in its back row, his **From Above** power will give him +2/+2. Ka kaw!

# Weapon Omega (MC) 
Set: The Utopia Battles  
**Mutant Energy Absorption**  
**Mutant Energy Absorption**’s effect has no duration. So a character that loses and can’t gain powers this way, will remain like that until it leaves play. 

**Addicted to Mutant Energy**   
**Addicted to Mutant Energy** affects a character as it appears, which means it won’t even trigger any of its powers that occur when it appears. It also has no duration, so a character affected by it will remain affected until that character leaves play.

# Willow (SC) 
Set: The Buffy Battles  
**Spell Research**  
Willow’s **Spell Research** power puts Plot Twists into a special pile removed from the game called your Spellbook. Your Spellbook can’t have more than one copy of the same Plot Twist. 

**Spellcasting**  
Her Spellcasting power lets you play Plot Twists from your Spellbook, putting them into your KO pile when they resolve. 

If Willow gets KO’d or otherwise is no longer on your side, you won’t be able to access the Plot Twists in your Spellbook. But if you play another copy of Willow, then you can use your Spellbook again.

# X-23 (MC)
Set: New Mutants  
X-23 is one of the toughest mutants around. So tough in fact that she only has a Level 1 main character. She can’t level up and she doesn’t care.

# Xander (SC) 
Set: The Buffy Battles
When Xander hides, turn him face down but in the ready orientation. Remove all +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters and Equipment from him. A hidden character doesn’t count as being stunned, but it still can’t attack or defend, it doesn’t protect anyone behind it, and loses its powers. It still keeps its other information like name and team affiliation. If a hidden character gets stunned somehow, change it to the stunned orientation (face down and exhausted). A hidden character will turn face up the same time your stunned characters would recover.
