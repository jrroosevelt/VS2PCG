The following card-specific information is a culmination of clarifications, rule changes, and FAQs from various sources. After each item (or series of items), there's a "Source" indicator that specifies whether the item came from:
* Rule inserts from the set
* An official FAQ doc published by Upper Deck Entertainment (UDE FAQ)
* An official rule change, clarification, or errata
* A community source, such as Facebook or Discord. (Some of these have been officially approved by UDE and, if so, are noted in the source citation). 

**Note**: There have been some minor editorial liberties taken (not all are exact quotations from the main source). These changes are mainly cosmetic or made to help understand context outside of the rulesheet and do not fundamentally change the intent of the original text.

# [Abomination](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu1-033.jpg)
*Set: MCU Battles*
  
Abomination’s **Give Me a Real Fight!** Power forces a player’s first attack to include a specific character and the defender must be Abomination. However if either that character can’t attack or Abomination can’t be attacked, the effect does nothing. Also, the player can choose not to attack at all on their turn.

# [Adam Warlock](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-001.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Galactic Guardians* 
 
At [Level 1](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-001.jpg), if Adam Warlock gets KO'd by getting stunned, **Prepare for Rebirth** will cause him to gain an XP and become [Level 2](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-002.jpg) while in the stunned position. (If a power like Hex prevents him from leveling up, he'll remain at Level 1 but still heal his wounds.)

*Q:   If I don’t use his Emerge power, will he recover normally during my next Recovery Phase?*

A: Yes. But he’s huge! Spend that MIGHT and start bashing with him right away, man!

# [Agatha Harkness](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-013.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

If Agatha appearing on your side KOs an Agatha that was already on your side (due to uniqueness), **Ancient Sorceress** will count the Agatha that was KO'd.

# [Ajax](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-012.jpg)
*Set: Deadpool & Friends*  

Ajax's **Pain Tolerance** power says he can only be KO'd by fatal wounds at the end of a turn. A character has fatal wounds if it has at least as many wounds as its health. So Ajax can have any amount of wounds but won't actually get KO'd until the end of a turn.

# [Alcatraz](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HAM-019.jpg)
*Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.*  

Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
When the character in “prison” turns face up, the player who used Alcatraz decides which row on its original side it goes back to.

# [Alicia Masters](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-009.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Here's an example of how her **Neo-Realistic Sculptor** works. The Thing is on your side, who has 10/6 ATK/DEF. While Alicia is also on your side, his ATK/DEF become  10/10.

# [Armor](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-018.jpg) 
*Set: The Utopia Battles*  

**Psionic Exoskeleton** is a combat power, but its effect lasts for the rest of the turn.

# [Angel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/RES-001.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Resistance*  

When Angel levels up, he transforms into [Archangel](#wiki_archangel). When this happens, he keeps his orientation (ready/exhausted, face-up/face-down), all of his counters, and any effects on him. Also note Archangel doesn’t have a Level 1 version. The only way to becomehim normally is to start the game with (Resistance) Level 1 Angel as your Main Character.

# [Angel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-001.jpg)/[Angelus](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-028.jpg) (MC) 
*Set: The Buffy Battles*  

Level 1 Angel and Angelus can transform between each other. However, when you build a deck you must choose either Angel or Angelus to be your starting Main Character. (You must lock in your decision at the time you build your deck, not after you see what Main Character your opponent is using.) When Angel transforms into Angelus or vice versa, he keeps his orientation (ready/exhausted, face up/face down), all of his counters (including XP), and any effects on him.

^(Source: Rule insert)
# [Angela](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-015.jpg)
*Set: Galactic Guardians*  

**An Angel From the Heavens** makes it difficult for Angela to be solo attacked. An attacker must have (Flight) or (Range) (or both) to solo attack her. 

When Angela opens a **Bridge to Heven**, you must put each revealed character onto your side. This may cause some characters to be KO'd due to the uniqueness rules.

# [Anya](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-018.jpg) 
*Set: The Buffy Battles*

Her **Newly Human and Strangely Literal** power ignores all stat increases including +1/+1 counters. It doesn’t remove the counters – they just have no effect this turn.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Archangel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/RES-002.jpg)
*Set: Resistance*  

**Violent** means that he strikes Supporting Characters with double his ATK.

# [Ardina](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HER-008.jpg)
*Set: The Herald*  

**Clone of the Silver Surfer** refers to the "card title" Silver Surfer. This means the name at the very top of the card must be Silver Surfer. **AKA**s don't count.

^(Source: Rule insert)

If Ardina appears via some mechanism other than being recruited (such as being brought along by Lockjaw or Legacy), you do not have to pay the additional cost of wounding Silver Surfer.

# [Arnim Zola](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-001.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Crossover* 
 
**ESP Box** takes effect once the game starts and lasts the whole game (even while Arnim Zola is stunned, after he levels up, and even after he is KO’d). You can play any Equipment as a Supporting Character, regardless of whether you have a character with a matching team affiliation. When you play one as a Supporting Character, it’s no longer an Equipment. If it has a power that references “Equipped Character,” it is its own equipped character. When the card leaves play it will go back to being an Equipment. You may still play an Equipment normally and equip it to one of your characters (including on an Equipment that you played as a Supporting Character). 

When Arnim Zola enters **A New Robot Body**, your new Equipment-turned-Main Character will have ATK/DEF equal to its cost, 1 (Health), Swarm, and it will count as its own “Equipped Character,” just like with ESP Box. When that body gets KO’d, it can use this power again to jump into another robot body, and so on. Note: if you want to use a Wild Special Location to pay for this power, it must match the team affiliation of the Main Character using this power.

# Avalanche
## [Avalanche](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BOM-009.jpg) (Brotherhood)
*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*  

Avalanche’s **Sustained Seismic Waves** power gets stronger each time he uses it. However, if you play a new copy of Avalanche later, the super power on that copy will start over.

## [Avalanche](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-022.jpg) (Resistance)
*Set: The Utopia Battles*  

**The Big One** KOs basic Locations with different types. The types are:

* Energy (Blue)  
* Intellect (Yellow)  
* Might (Green)
* Skill (Red)  
* Alien (Space)
* Humanity (Earth)

# [Awesome Android](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-042.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

If there are no other face-up characters in play, Awesome Android's ATK/DEF become 0/0 (and he gets stunned).

# [Baron Mordo](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/LEG-048.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Legacy*  

Baron Mordo can revert a main character back to level 1 until your next turn. When the effect wears off, the character goes back to whatever level and card it was before.

Q: If I **Hypnotize** a Ripley #8 L2 that started the game as Sister Ripley, which Level 1 Character does she become? Sister Ripley or Ripley#8 level 1?

A: Ripley #8 Level 1. A character will always become the level one version of what it is.  

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel)

---
Q: Does **Hex** prevent a **Hypnotized** character from turning back into Level 2 at the start of my next turn?

A: No, Hypnotize creates a modifier with an expiration that temporarily makes a character its Level 1 version. When that modifier expires it becomes its Level 2 version again, and this is not considered Leveling up.

# [Beast](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/DFX-010.jpg) 
*Set: The New Defenders*

^(Source: Rule insert)

# \* [Bishop](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/LEG-015.jpg) \*
*Set: Legacy*  

**Energy Transference**  
This power refers to (Energy/"Blue") super powers.This counts for any super power with the appropriate symbol in its cost (even if it also has other symbols in its cost).

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Black Bolt](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MMU-037.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Monsters Unleashed!*  

Black Bolt’s Super Powers use the Amplify ability. When you use a Super Power, if you discard a Location (instead of turning it face-down in your resource row), you get the Amplify text. Previous Amplify Super Powers grant an effect to begin with but a larger effect if you Amplify it. Black Bolt’s powers only grant an effect if you Amplify them.

# Black Cat
## [Black Cat](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/aff-028.jpg) (MC)
*Set: A-Force*

Q: If Satana is in play and Black Cat attacks a defender and uses **Cross their Path** to Daze that character, is it KO'd by Lethal?

A: Daze counts as stunning, but Lethal was changed to work when a wounding a defending supporting character. Since Daze does not wound, lethal is not applied.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel)

## [Black Cat](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SPF-012.jpg) (SC - unaffiliated)
*Set: Spider-Friends*  

**Personal Loyalty**  
Black Cat has often wavered between being a hero and a villain. In the game she doesn’t have a team affiliation and is neither Good nor Evil… until she’s on a side (she is neither Good nor Evil while she is in your hand, deck, or KO pile). Then if Spider-Man is your main character, he has a good influence on her and she’ll ferociously fight alongside her partner. But if he’s not your main character, she’ll go back to slinking around as a criminal.

# [Blackheart](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-048.jpg)
*Set: Defenders*

Q: [Even the Odds](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-076.jpg) targeting Blackheart. He resets to a 4/4 for the rest of the combat, yes? His power does not turn on until the next combat he becomes involved in?

A: Even the Odds creates a modifier that overrides or suppresses any other modifiers modifying ATK/DEF for THAT COMBAT. Any modifiers that with a duration longer than the the combat will "turn on" after the combat has passed.

# Black Panther
## [Black Panther](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/COS-001.jpg) (MC - Illustrated)
*Set: Cosmic Avengers*  

For Black Panther's **Passing Down the Knowledge**, whenever more than one card is put into your KO pile at the same time, he still only gains 1 XP.

^(Source: Rule insert)

## [Black Panther](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu2-003.jpg) (MC - Photo)
*Set: MCU Heroes*  

Black Panther Black Panther’s **Vibranium Weave Suit** power prevents him from being struck for the entire turn including the combat he’s currently in.

## [Black Panther](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu2-014.jpg) (SC)
*Set: MCU Heroes*  

Black Panther Black Panther’s **Bulletproof** power prevents enemy characters with [Range] from striking him. It doesn’t matter if Black Panther is attacking or defending, or if it’s a melee attack or ranged attack. As long as a character has [Range] it can’t strike him.

# Blob 
## [Blob](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-003.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Crossover*  

If Blob strikes a character and his **Boing!** power causes that character to strike itself, you add Blob’s ATK to that character’s own ATK to see if it’s enough to stun it. 

**Immovable Object**  
If Blob moves for any reason (including during your Formation Step or because another effect moves him), he will be prevented from gaining an XP. At the end of Blob’s first turn of the game, he will gain an XP if he didn’t move that turn.

^(Source: Rule insert)

## [Blob](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BOM-015.jpg) (SC)
*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*  

Blob’s **Stuck in His Stomach** power represents a melee attacker getting temporarily trapped by Blob’s flab. This effect will take place even if Blob gets KO’d in the attack. (Just imagine him unconscious lying on top of the attacker.)
 
And his **Bounced Off His Belly** power represents projectiles getting bounced back at any ranged attackers. Note: In the event that Blob somehow had (Range) he would not strike back using his own ATK because Bounced Off His Belly’s strike back would override his normal strike back.

# [Boomerang](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SFO-008.jpg)
*Set: Spidey-Foes*  

**Specialized Boomerangs**  
Boomerang can "throw" a different Boomerang each turn at one front row and one back row enemy. You can choose a front row character on one side and a back row character on a different side. If there are no enemy front row characters you can just choose an enemy back row character (and vice versa).

# [Break the Fourth Wall](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-019.jpg)
*Set: Deadpool & Friends*  

This plot twist really lets you get in the game. When you put a “Me” token onto your side, you get to choose a team affiliation and your age will determine your ATK and DEF. You’ll have Leader because you’re still in charge of your team, but don’t worry – if you get KO’d you don’t lose the game because you’re also still a player. We figure you have more questions about all this, so let’s dive in. 

* **How do you prove your age?** If you’re at a tournament you’ll need an ID with a birthday. If you don’t have one, we’ll just pretend you’re 11.  

* **Does this card have different power levels for different players depending on their age?** Yes.  

* **Isn’t that ageist?** Great question. Think about it this way: Yes.  

* **What happens if I’m 29 and tomorrow’s my birthday, but then it turns to midnight in the middle of the game?** You’ll become a 3/0 and get stunned.  

* **Isn’t that kind of stupid?** Play faster next time.

* **I feel like you’re not taking this seriously.** That’s not a question.

# [Bruce Banner](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu1-003.jpg) (and the Hulk) (MC)
*Set: The MCU Battles*  

Bruce doesn’t level up. Instead, when he attacks he transforms right into the Hulk Level 2 main character. Note: Hulk doesn’t have a Level 1 version. The only way to become him is to start as Bruce.

# [Buffy](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-003.jpg) (MC) 
*Set: The Buffy Battles*  

Buffy’s **Save the World. A Lot.** power lets her Slay an Evil Main Character. If she does and it’s the last enemy Main Character in play, you win immediately! But if something goes wrong or there are other enemy Main Characters left, Buffy will get KO’d at the end of the turn.

# [Build a Better World](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/aff-025.jpg)
*Set: A-Force*

Q: If I need to play two of the same color locations for an ability, can I play a plot twist in between to turn a location face up? Or do I need to use two different locations to pay the cost?

A: When you pay a cost, you have to pay the entire cost, and you can not play any other powers or plot twists while you are in the middle of playing a power.

# [Bullseye](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-027.jpg) (MC)
*Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.*  

When Bullseye uses **Perfect Aim** it will give him ATK until it’s equal to the defender’s DEF. But if the Defender gains or loses DEF later in the combat, that won’t affect Bullseye’s ATK.

**Everything’s a Weapon**  
With **Everything’s a Weapon**, you’ll put the top card of your deck into your KO pile before you choose which enemy character to apply the effect to.

# Cable
## [Cable](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/small/NEW-001.jpg) (MC)
*Set: New Mutants*  

Cable’s **Advanced Cybernetics** power gives all your equipment everywhere the (X-Men) team affiliation for a turn. This makes it so you can play any equipment even if you don’t have a character that matches the equipment’s printed team affiliation.

## [Cable](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-045.jpg) (SC)
*Set: The Marvel Battles*

Q: How does his **Ultimate Soldier** power work?

A: When you activate his power while he’s attacking, it means the defender will get stunned at the end of the combat even if the attackers’ ATK isn’t as much as the defender’s DEF.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

---

Q: What happens if I use his power but the combat gets canceled?

A: Cable’s power has no effect since the combat didn’t come to its natural conclusion. It doesn’t matter if the combat was canceled due to a card effect like **Think Again** or due to all of the attackers getting stunned.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

---

Q: What happens if he’s team attacking and I use his power, but then he gets stunned before the combat resolves?

A: His power will still trigger and stun the defender even though Cable himself got stunned before the combat resolved. This is because once an effect resolves and creates a modifier, it is independent from the source that created it.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

# Captain America (MC)
*Set: The Marvel Battles*

Q: Does his **Avengers Assemble** power work even if he’s not one of the team attackers?

A: Yes.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

---

Q: If Cap team attacks with one other character, but in the middle of combat the other character gets stunned by a Plot Twist or Super Power, but Cap still stuns the defender, will he get an XP?

A: No. Once the other character gets stunned mid-combat, it stops being a team attack and becomes a solo attack so Cap won’t get the XP. For Cap to get the XP it must be a team attack at the end of the combat.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

# \* [Captain Marvel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/COS-012.jpg) \*
*Set: Cosmic Avengers*  

His **Cosmic Awareness** allows him to ask an opponent one concrete question about their hand. The answer has to be truthful. In a casual setting, use the honor system, or a bystander to help out. In a more formal setting, you can ask a judge. Good examples of questions to ask are: 
* "Do you have any Plot Twists in your hand?"  
* "Do you have any Fin Fang Fooms in your hand?"  
* "Do you have a 7 cost card in your hand?"

# [Carnage](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-035.jpg)
*Set: The Defenders*  

**Maximum Carnage**  
Carnage’s power triggers when he stuns or gets stunned. So it’s possible for it to trigger twice in one combat.

# Chameleon
## [Chameleon](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SFO-001.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Spidey-Foes*  

If Chameleon appears in the middle of the game, then **Blessing in Disguise** will copy any "appears" powers on face-up **Sinister Syndicate** Supporting Characters on your side.

## [Chameleon](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SYN-007.jpg) (SC)
*Set: Sinister Syndicate*  

**Master of Disguise**  
Chameleon does copy the **Sinister Six** keyword from your main characters who have that keyword. It doesn’t do anything for him in the game because he’s not a main character – he just wants to feel like a real part of the team.

# [The Champion](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV2-019.jpg)
*Set: Crossover Vol. 2*  

**Primordial Power**  
(Infinite) ATK means the Champion will always have enough ATK to stun a defender and his DEF will always be high enough to avoid getting stunned by a defender's strike. Although if somehow, the defender also has infinite ATK and DEF, then both characters will get stunned. (In other words, infinite ATK is treated as equal to infinite DEF which results in a stun. It's maths.)

# [Chimichanga](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-021.jpg)
*Set: Deadpool & Friends*  

Deadpool’s favorite deep-fried burrito has two different costs to use its super power. You must choose which cost to pay – you can’t combine them. For example, you couldn’t pay **(Energy)** and **(Intellect)** and then say Chimichanga twice. That would be madness.

# Copycat
*Set: Deadpool & Friends*

Q: If I remove Copycat to Singularity's **Pocket Dimension** with two other characters, when all 3 return does Copycat get all the powers of the other two supporting characters she returned with?

A: If a modifier's duration would expire before it is created, then it is never created. Basically if two supporting characters appeared at the same time, they would both cause her to trigger, but also both cause the other to expire since they appeared simultaneously.

# [Cosmo](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-004.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Galactic Guardians*  

With **All Bark, No Flight** each power lost grants 1 XP. So if a character loses three powers, Cosmo gains 3 XP. **Note:** (Flight) and (Range) are both keyword powers. A character must lose a power and remain face up in order for Cosmo to gain an XP. Losing powers because a character turned face down doesn't count.

You will draw two cards with **They’ll Follow Him** if you have one Supporting Character that is both (Brotherhood) and (X-Men). Similarly, a multi-affiliation character can satisfy more than one of the requirements of **The Squad I’ve Put Together** and **Trust the Plan**. 

Note: **Trust the Plan** will only put three +1/+1 counters on a character even if you’re using it to satisfy two or more of the requirements. And even if you have several characters of all three required affiliations, Trust the Plan can only ever put three counters on three characters maximum.

# [Daredevil](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-002.jpg) (MC)
*Set: The Defenders*  

**Radar Sense**  
Daredevil and Rhino have effects that allow an enemy player to spend a (Skill/"Red") or (Intellect/"Yellow") to do something. In this case, they can use a Training Ground or Academy to pay for the effect, but not a special Location like Fisk Tower.

**Protector of Hell's Kitchen**
Q: If I attack Daredevil with Mary Walker (Typhoid Mary) and I put a -1/-1 counter on Daredevil and one on the only character he's protecting which happens to have 1 defense (like Black Widow), KO'ing her, does Daredevil gets an XP?

A: The turn player decides the order per page 9 of the rule book under "Timing." Daredevil's level up power has an intervening "if" clause, which means the condition must be true when it triggers AND when it resolves. So if the turn player decides to resolve Mary Walker's power before Daredevil's power, Daredevil will not get an XP because he won't be protecting anyone once his level up power resolves. On the other hand, if the turn player decides to resolve Daredevil's power before Mary's then Daredevil will gain an XP.

*Set: Crossover*  

**Deconstruct the Universe**  
When Deconstructs the Universe, an entire concept of the game gets removed for the rest of the game (even if she leaves play). If, as a result of this, the wording of a card’s power is unclear, the part that is unclear does nothing. Here’s how removing each concept works: 

* **+1/+1 and -1/-1 counters:** Remove all of those counters from the game. Remove the phrases “+1/+1 counter” and “-1/-1 counter” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause these counters to enter the game in any way 
 
* **Equipment**: Remove all Equipment cards everywhere from the game. This includes all sides, decks, hands, KO piles, and Equipment that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Equipment cards but don’t currently count as Equipment (such as a face-down resource or an Equipment that has become a character via Arnim Zola’s   
**ESP Box**). Remove the term “Equipment” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Equipment to enter the game in any way.  

* **Keyword text:** Removing this concept doesn’t affect **Flight** and **Range**. Remove all Keyword text from the game, including powers that “can’t be turned off”. Remove the term “Keyword” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Keyword text to enter the game in any way.  
 
* **Levels:** All Main Characters everywhere become Level 1 if possible. Remove all remaining Level 2 and higher Main Characters from the game. Remove all Level Up Powers and XP from the game, and the terms “Level” and “XP” from all card text. Ignore any effects that would cause XP or a Level 2 or higher Main Character to enter the game in any way.  

* **Plot Twists:** Remove all Plot Twist cards everywhere from the game. This includes all decks, hands, KO piles, and Plot Twists that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Plot Twist cards but are not currently Plot Twists (such as a face-down resource). Remove the term “Plot Twist” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause a Plot Twist to enter the game in any way.  

* **Super Powers:** Remove all Super Powers from the game. Remove the term “Super Power” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Super Powers to enter the game in any way.

Dawn can’t start the game in a deck. Instead, if Buffy is your Main Character or a Supporting Character in your deck, you get to have a Key pile which includes four copies of Dawn. You can recruit Dawn while Buffy is on your side. If Dawn gets KO’d, she’ll go to your KO pile as normal.

# Deadpool
## [Deadpool](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-004.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Deadpool & Friends*

> Hiya kids, it’s your old pal, Deadpool. Guess what? I’m the First character in the game to go all the way to Level 4. There’s probably a break-the-fourth-wall joke in there somewhere, but I haven’t found it yet. Anyhoo, the powers that be want me to tell you that even though I’m now on two different main character cards, the (X-Men) and (Underworld) versions of me can’t level up into each other.  
> 
> It’s because a main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork. And guess what? I don’t mean to brag but I’m actually a designer now. You know all the cards in this set that you love? That’s right -- I designed them. (All the cards that you hate were designed by those other two dummies.) Designing stuff is sweet. You can pretty much do whatever you want.  
> 
> I like designing so much, I wanted to do some while I was in the game too. My new main character can **nerf** stuff, **errata** stuff, and even **ban** stuff. Check it out:  

**I'm Taking Over From These Idiot Designers**  
  
* **Nerf:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks, and KO piles are 0/1 with 1 and nothing can ever, ever change that.  

* **Errata:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles lose and can’t gain powers (including (*Flight*) and (*Range*)). 
 
* **Ban:** Name a character and choose a number. Put all supporting characters with that name on enemy sides into their owner’s hands. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles have a cost equal to the chosen number and nothing can ever, ever change that. (Except banning it again. You know the old saying: “If you really, really hate a card, ban it twice.”) Any effects that would increase or decrease what an enemy player pays to recruit a banned card are ignored.  

Here are some quick tips:  

* If you steal a character with one of those effects the effect will stop because it’s not an enemy character anymore. Yay! However, if it goes back to an enemy side the effect will turn on again. Boo!  

* When you Ban a character, you can name any number you want. Even a million bazillion. Try it, it’s fun!

* If someone tries to tell you that this isn’t really how nerfing, errata-ing, and banning works, you just take your katana and do some "development” on them, if you know what I mean.

## Deadpool (MC)
*Set: The Marvel Battles*

Q: If I use **Merc With a Mouth** to make my Gambit or Dazzler Lethal, will they KO a character by using their Super Powers to stun them?

A: No, for Lethal to work a character with Lethal needs to wound a Defending supporting character during Combat. Dazzler and Gambit use their Super Powers during the Main Phase.

**Man, There's Noone Left to Kill**
Q: If I’m playing with 3 or 4 players, do ALL enemy characters have to be stunned for Deadpool to gain an XP?

A: No. At the end of your turn, if any enemy player has no face-up characters, Deadpool will gain 1 XP. (If two or more players have all stunned characters, Deadpool still only gains 1 XP.)

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

---

Q: What’s going on with his **Oh, there’s someone! Hi there!** power?

A: If all of an enemy player’s characters are stunned, Deadpool can attack that player. If the attack stuns the player, that player is KO’d and is out of the game. (The same way as if his Main Character has been KO’d.)

Q: What does “the player counts as a supporting character” mean?

A: It means that if Deadpool is attacking you, you can play Plot Twists that would help a supporting character to increase your stats or otherwise survive the combat.

Q: What if an effect puts a +1/+1 or -1/-1 counter on me while I’m defending against Deadpool?

A: It goes on you. If this puts you to 0 DEF, you’ll get stunned (and KO’d). If it makes your stats better, that could help you survive this attack and will stick around to help you if he attacks you again on a later turn.

Q: What if I get KO’d?

A: You’re out of the game, the same way as if your Main Character got KO’d. (You do not actually lose consciousness.)

Q: After Deadpool uses his **Oh, there’s Someone! Hi there!** power, can he team attack a player?

A: No, the other characters don’t know what a player is.

## Deadpool (SC)
*Set: The Marvel Battles*

Q: If I have both Silver Sable and Deadpool, can they both enter a team attack with my Main Character?

A: No, For a team attack to be legal, all characters have to be on the same team or legal to attack with each other. Deadpool & Silver Sable are not on the same team and can only team attack with Main Characters, not each other.

# [Death](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-001.jpg)
*Set: Black Order*  

Death is **Amortal** which means:

* She has no level (She is beyond such mortal trappings).  
* She starts with her card that has infinite health. (Her other card has 8 health, also known as sideways infinity.)  
* She can't be face down. If she would be turned face down, switch her with her other card instead and leave it face up. For example when she gets stunned, instead of turning her face down, switch her with her other card which will remain face up. She still suffers other effects from the stun such as losing the +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters, gaining a wound, and becoming exhausted.  
* If she would be hidden, instead switch her with her other card which will remain face up and place her in the ready position.  
* Amortal can't be turned off.
 
Since Death doesn't turn face down, she can be stunned multiple times in a single turn. However, if she takes fatal wounds she's not really defeated. She's just temporarily lost interest in this mortal battle. (The player who was using her is defeated, though.) 

**Note:** While death is technically two cards, you could slip her into a single clear card sleeve with her cards back to back. Then when she would turn face down, you can just flip her to her other "side."  

**Mistress of the Infinity Well** allows each player to draw an extra card each time you draw cards. For example, when you draw your usual two cards during your Draw Phase, you'll draw an extra one. And if you have a **Genius** in play that lets you draw a card, you'll draw an extra one then, too.

While this card is face down in your Resource Row, you can play it as if it was in your hand. If you do, put it into your KO pile as normal, then replace it with the top card of your deck, face down. If you have no cards in your deck, you can still play it, you just won’t be able to replace it.

Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur each have two different team affiliations. Moon Girl is on the Inhumans and Devil Dinosaur is on the Monsters Unleashed team. But both of them are also on the Moon Girl/Devil Dinosaur team. This allows them to Team Attack together or with members of their respective teams.(Keep in mind all members of a Team Attack must share at least one team affiliation.)

When Devil-Slayer and the defender strike each other: 

* Devil-Slayer can be stunned as normal.  
* A hidden character can get stunned as normal. (Wound it and change it from ready to exhausted.) 
* If Devil-Slayer’s strike would stun an already-stunned character, just wound it instead.

Doctor Doom's **Time Platform**  does something very odd. It shuffles a card into a deck face up. We suggest you close your eyes when shuffling a deck with a face-up card in it. In a tournament, you can always ask a judge to shuffle the deck if necessary. Once the deck is shuffled, where the card is in the deck is public information, so we also suggest you turn it 90 degrees so it's sticking out of your deck.

# Dramatic Entrance
*Set: A-Force* 

Q: Do "Appears" powers work when character are brought into play with Dramatic Entrance? I'm not sure because it says, "put into play."

A: It does not matter how a character enters play. If it goes from not being in play, to being in play, it has "appeared" whether that is from recruiting, or some other effect putting it into play.

Q: How does Dramatic Entrance work if I bring a Loki 7 drop SC into play with it? Does Loki draw me a card if it was the first PT I played that turn? Or since it wasn't in play, it doesn't grant me the benefit? If it doesn't, then does the next PT I play that turn trigger Loki's Schemer power?

A: If you bring in Loki SC with Dramatic Entrance, Schemer will not trigger. At the time you PLAYED the plot twist, Loki was not in play. Once he is in play, he does not look back in time and see that you played a plot twist. Also if you play another plot twist, Schemer will still not trigger because it is not your first plot twist played this turn.

Q: If you dramatic entrance a Wasp or Ant-man can you just Shrink the combat?

A: The triggering event for Shrink is "When [this character] gets attacked for the first time each turn..." and by the time you play Dramatic Entrance, you are past the point which Shrink would trigger.

Q: Can you bring a character in with Dramatic Entrance that is already on the field? If so, does it KO the one on the field?

Q: If I use Dramatic Entrance to put Adam Warlock into play as the new Defender, what happens since he comes into play stunned due to his **Evolutionary Cocoon**?

A: The original defender is still removed from combat, but since Adam enters play stunned, he can not become the defender, so he will enter play and he will be unable to become the defender. Since there is no defender, the combat will end, at which point, the delayed trigger will trigger and KO Adam Warlock.

Since this is a "transformation", the Lizard will keep any counters and effects that Dr. Connors had (including a wound counter since he was just stunned).

You can include up to the usual four copies of Lizard in your deck as well as bring up to four copies for your Lizard pile (one for each copy of Dr. Cur Connors in your deck). If you don't have any Lizards in your Lizard pile, **The Monster Within** won't do anything.

*Set: Defenders*

Q: If I activate L2 Dr. Strange's **Mass Transmutation** power can I target a character with +1/+1 counters as well as a character with -1/-1 counters and switch them to their opposite counter types?

A: Yes, **Mass Transmutation** states "For each one, remove it's +1/+1 counters and put that many -1/-1 counters, or vice versa" so in this case you would be able to state which characters you're choosing as well as what counters are to be removed and which ones are to replace for each character.

**Mass Transmutation**
Q: If my opponent has Dagger in play would Doctor strange be able to turn an opponent's counters to negative counters?

For example, when a character with 1  printed (Health) appears, it will have 1 remaining health. If a character has 3 printed (Health) and is getting +1 (Health) from an effect and has 2 wounds, its remaining health is 2 (3 + 1 – 2 = 2).

Q: Can I choose Elektra to be discarded with Helmut Zemo's **Sow Distrust**?

A: While Elektra is in your hand, you do not control a Main Character. Therefore, she is a valid choice.

Q: If I activate Kingpin's **Underworld Boss** while Elektra is in my hand, what happens to Elektra?

A: She is demoted to a Supporting character no matter what zone she is in. From the rules: "Some effects may promote a Supporting Character to Main Character and vice versa. Unlike most modifiers, these modifiers can apply to a Main Character in any zone (or side) and continue to apply to the character even if it changes zones."

## [Emma Frost](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-005.jpg) (MC)

**Keeper of Law** allows a character to strike an additional time in a combat. The character can strike two different characters once each (if they’re being team attacked, for example), or they can strike the same character twice. In the latter case, add the character’s ATK together for each strike and then compare it to the enemy’s DEF. 

Emma’s power can be used any number of times each turn. So if a character ends up being allowed to strike 3, 4, or more times, it works as above. Any number of strikes can be combined against an enemy or split amongst multiple enemies.

Q: Hello, a question about the Perfect Organism and Even The Odds. If I use the ability to strike with double of the attack, (**This Thing is Huge! It's...It's Big!** / **Fearless**) and my opponent plays Even The Odds, what happen?

A: This **Thing is Huge! It's... It's Big!** does not actually modify the ATK. It is modifying how hard it strikes during combat resolution. Normally when you strike, you strike an equal amount to your ATK. This power (and the Daredevil one) changes the rules of the game so that you are striking with double that amount, or triple with Amplify.

# [Evil Deadpool](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-005.jpg)
*Set: Deadpool & Friends* 
  
Made from Deadpool’s discarded body parts that fused back together into a new person, Evil Deadpool gains XP whenever you discard a character. This includes powering up as well as any effect that causes you to “discard” a card (whether you or your opponent controls the effect).

**Merc With an Evil Mouth**  
Evil Deadpool loves being Evil. That’s why he can grant Evil characters on your side the new keyword, Evil Lethal. Evil Lethal works just like regular Lethal except after you KO the supporting defender you laugh evilly. (If you’re unable to laugh evilly you’ll still resolve the effect as much as possible and KO the defender.)  

**It's Like You, But Eviler!**  
Evil Deadpool’s Level 2 super power puts Good characters into play but turns them Evil and adds the word “Evil” at the beginning of their name. Changing their name DOES affect the uniqueness rules. For example, it would allow you to have “Iron Man” and “Evil Iron Man” on your side at the same time. However, you would not be able to add “Evil” to regular Deadpool because then his name would be “Evil Deadpool” which is the same name as your main character. And Evil Deadpool hates Deadpool anyway.

* When an Ovomorph is ready to Hatch, reveal a random card from your Facehugger Pile.  
* If you reveal the Extended Incubation card, the Ovomorph doesn’t open yet. Shuffle the Extended Incubation card back into your Facehugger Pile.  
* If you reveal a Facehugger token character, KO its Ovomorph, put the Facehugger into your Back Row, and it captures an enemy supporting character. (It can capture a face-up or stunned supporting character.)  

“Capture” is a new game action that means:  

 - Remove the Captive card from the game, but keep any wound counters on it.  
 - Put the Captive card next to (or underneath) its Captor to make it clear who its Captor is.  
 - When the Captor leaves play, put its Captive back into play stunned in its owner’s back row.

# [The First Evil](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-034.jpg) (MC) 
*Set: The Buffy Battles*  

If two or more players are playing as The First Evil, they will need to randomly determine who chooses which one takes the first turn.

# Franklin Richards
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Franklin is one of the most powerful beings in the multiverse. So powerful he has been able to, from a young age, create a **Pocket Universe**. Here's what happens when he does that:

* Move each Character other than Franklin to the side of the playing space. **They are now in a separate part of the game.**
    * A **Pocket Universe** has only front and back rows (no resource row).  
    * When the characters are moved to the **Pocket Universe** they stay in the same rows they were in in the original universe. They keep all their counters and their orientation (ready/exhausted; face up/face down).  
    * The **Pocket Universe** is still in the same overall game as the original universe. So cards don't "appear" or "leave play" when they move from the original universe to the **Pocket Universe** or vice versa.  
    * Cards in the **Pocket Universe** cannot attack or otherwise affect cards in the original universe and vice versa.  
    * The Uniqueness rules don't apply across the **Pocket Universe** and original universe. (For example, you could have a Human Torch in both Universes.)  
    * Note: Your hand, deck, KO pile, and out-of-game piles can be accessed in both the original universe and the **Pocket Universe** (more on this below).  
* Each player who has characters in a **Pocket Universe** will take a separate turn in that **Pocket Universe** after their normal turn (before the next player's normal turn, and including the turn Franklin creates the **Pocket Universe**).  
    * First take your normal turn. During this turn, ignore the **Pocket Universe**.  
    * After your turn is over, you then take a **Pocket Universe** turn. During this turn, ignore the original universe.  
    * The cars you play on a particular turn can only affect that turn's universe.  
* A **Pocket Universe** turn sequence is a little different than a normal turn, as follows:  
    * Start of turn  
        * Note that there is no Draw Phase.  
    * Recovery Phase  
    * Formation Step  
        * Note that there is no Build Phase because there are no Recruit Points or resource rows in the **Pocket Universe**.  
    * Main Phase  
        * This works just like a "Normal" Main Phase in regard to combats.  
        * You can play Plot Twists from our hand to affect a **Pocket Universe**.
        * You can discard Locations from your hand to generate a power symbol in the **Pocket Universe**. (Since the **Pocket Universe** has no resource row, there are no locations to turn face down to generate a power symbol.)  
        * You can discard characters from your hand to Power Up characters in a **Pocket Universe**.
        * When a character is KO'd in a **Pocket Universe**, they go to the normal KO pile. Similarly, if a character leaves play due to an effect, it works the same as if the character were still in the original universe. For example, if an effect returned teh character to its owner's hand, it would go to that hand as normal.
    * End of turn
* If there is more than one **Pocket Universe** in the game, each player will take their normal turn first, then a **Pocket Universe** turn for each **Pocket Universe** they have characters in, starting with the first **Pocket Universe** created, then the second, etc.
    * Cards in one **Pocket Universe** cannot attack or otherwise affect cards in another **Pocket Universe**.
* When Franklin leaves play, the characters from each **Pocket Universe** he created pop back into the original universe part of the game, in the same rows and with the same orientation they were in their **Pocket Universe**.
    * If this leads to more than one character with teh same name on your side, KO all except one (your choice).

# [Gadget](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-023.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

This Plot Twist can allow you to add an attacker to your attack. The attacker must be a face-up character on your side not already in the attack. Move the new attacker to the row from which the first attackers were attacking. It doesn't need to be ready to join the attack and doesn't exhaust when it's added to the attack and it ignores (Flight), (Range), and team restrictions for an attack.

# [The Gentlemen](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-043.jpg) 
*Set: The Buffy Battles*  

**Hush** prevents players from using effects that require you to “say” something or to “name” something. **Hush** also prevents players from talking. You can still communicate in other ways such as using hand signals, or writing things down. You can also make sounds without using your vocal chords. If a player does speak, do your best impersonation of a Gentleman in order to shush them. (There is no in-game penalty for speaking. It’s just not cool.)

# [Ghost Spider](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/WEB-003.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Webheads*  

**You Can Borrow This for a While** grants characters with the chosen name the **Dimensional Wristwatch** keyword. You can recruit a character with **Dimensional Wristwatch** directly from your deck: Announce you're recruiting them from your deck, search your deck for the character, shuffle your deck, and then recruit them (pay its cost and put it onto your side). 

If a character with the chosen name gets put back into your deck somehow it will regain **Dimensional Wristwatch** while it's in your deck.

**Ticket to the Multiverse** lets Ghost-Spider jump from your game to a neighboring game. You must have permission from all players in that game before Ghost-Spider can make the jump into their game.

If no one else is playing near you or you don't have permission to move Ghost-Spider, then remove her from the game until the start of your next turn.

When Ghost-Spider enters another game or gets removed from the game set aside all her counters and Equipment. She will reappear in her original game with those counters and Equipment.

If Ghost-Spider enters anotehr game of Vs. System 2PCG, you decide which player gains control over her. She can attack, gain counters, get stunned, get KO'd, etc., just like in her original game. However, no matter what happens she will go back to her original game at the start of your next turn. When she jumps back, any counters, Equipment, etc. that she gained in the other game will be removed.

If Ghost-Spider enters a game that isn't Vs. System 2PCG, it's up to the players in that game to decide exactly how she works in that game.

# [Global Information Network](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/COS-020.jpg)
*Set: Cosmic Avengers*  

In this Arc, we are playing around with how players can use locations besides super powers. In addition to cards like \* Thor \* and Hyperion (who have keyword powers which requires spending an (Intellect/"Yellow) and (Energy/"Blue")), each Issue will have a Plot Twist and Special Location that allow their main characters to have some pretty powerful effects on the game. A few things about these Plot Twists and Special Locations:

* They are not super powers.  
* Your main characters ust be face up to pay for them.  
* Your main characters can use a "Wild" Special Location from their team to pay for them.  
* These cards are neutral, so just like any other neutral cards, they can be in Loyalty decks.  
* The Special Locations don't count as location swith a specific power symbol (for powers like Black Widow Main Character's Level Up power **Red in Her Ledger** or ZZutak's **Paint to Life**).

# [Goblin Queen](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/aff-042.jpg)

# \* [Gorgon](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/small/SVH-013.jpg) \*
*Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra*  

**The Spear in the East**  
Gorgon’s power removes the stat benefit from +1/+1 counters on enemy characters. They still count as having the counters though. For example, if an enemy character with two +1/+1 counters gains a -1/-1 counter, you’ll still remove one of each counter type.

# [Green Goblin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-005.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Crossover*  

The Sinister Six have gained two new Main Characters to choose from. Remember, when you build a Sinister Six deck, you choose any six Sinister Six characters to go with that deck.

Goblin’s **Bag of Tricks** allows you to discard Locations to make him more powerful in combat. If this causes Goblin to strike “before each other character,” this means he strikes first even if any of the characters have, for example, a power like Ferocious. And if two Goblins are in combat with that ability, they’ll strike each other at the same time. If you discard an Oscorp Location, it’s like a wild: you can treat it as though it’s any of the other four Locations that you didn’t already discard this combat.

# [Hawkeye](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/COS-006.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Cosmic Avengers*  

Hawkeye's **Custom Quiver** means he starts the game with his 4 different Custom Arrows Plot Twists set to the side. Once he's level 2, you may use **I Am the Weapon** to draw a random **Custom Arrows** card each turn. Once a custom Arrow card is in your hand, it acts just like a regular Plot Twist. Note that to be able to play any of them, Hawkeye must be face-up on your side, but for the Combat PLot Twists he doesn't have to be in the combat himself (he can shoot really far). 

Please note that if you choose **Magnetic** on the **Utility Arrowheads** card, you *can* move the enemy equipment to an unequipped character on your side. Some of Hawkeye's **Custom Arrows** Have keywords and terms that aren't explained in full on them: 

* **[Sniper](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_sniper)**

*Set: The MCU Battles*   

Hulk’s **Hulk Like Raging Fire** power allows you to choose any number to give him that much ATK and DEF during combat. “Any number” means any whole number. Some popular examples are 7, 15, 211, 45,000, 100,000,000, and 9.

*Set: Spidey-Foes*  

**Fluid Tactics** lets you convert ATK from a **Combat** Plot Twist into DEF (or vice versa). For example, if you play a Plot Twist that gives him +3 ATK, you could have him gain +3 DEF instead. It has to be all or nothing. You can't play a Plot Twist that gives him +3 ATK and convert it into +2 ATK and +1 DEF.

Note: +1/+1 counters granted from Plot Twists can't be converted by **Fluid Tactics**.

# Impersonating Powers
*Set: Utopia Battles*   

Several characters have powers that impersonate other characters. These powers turn off immediately if the character they’re impersonating ever shows up. It doesn’t matter if the character that’s being impersonated is face up or face down or what side they’re on. Either way they count as being on “a side” and will turn off the Impersonation power.

# [Impossible Man](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-049.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

**Omnifarious**  
Impossible Man is three cards in one. He can be played as an Equipment, a Plot Twist, or a Supporting Character. Note that if he is an Equipment, his Equipment power has no name, so it can't be chosen by any effects that choose power names.

# [The In-Betweener](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV2-009.jpg)
*Set: Crossover Vol. 2*  

**Duality Itself** lets you put the In-Betweener onto your side between two turns of the game. You can even do this after an enemy player's first turn but before your first turn.

The In-Betweener couldn't decide exactly how much cost, ATK, DEF, and health to have so he ended up between two whole numbers. In most cases, his stats work like this. 1 ½ cost means you must pay 1 ½ recruit points to recruit him. So you will have ½ a recruit point left over. 4 ½ ATK means his strikes will stun a 4 DEF character but not a 5 DEF character. 3 ½ DEF means if he is struck with 3 ATK, he won't get stunned, but if he gets struck with 4 ATK he will get stunned. 2 ½ (Health) means 2 wounds won't KO him, but 3 wounds will.

# [The Infinity Gauntlet](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-017.jpg)
*Set: Black Order*  

While equipped, the Infinity Gauntlet allows you to turn any number of face-down Infinity Gem equipment in your resource row face up to show that you've "set" them into the Gauntlet. If a card with Infinity gets put into a KO pile from anywhere, you may shuffle it into its owner's deck. 

If the Gauntlet leaves play, leave the face-up Gems in your resource row as they are. However, you can no longer user their powers. If a character on your side equips the Gauntlet later in the game, those Gems will already be inset and its Wielder can use their power again.

**Infinite Power**  
This allows you to do anything you want for the rest of the game. Hera re some examples of things you could do:

* Put a +1/+1 counter on a character.  
* Take an extra turn.  
* Use a Build Phase power during your Main Phase.  
* Flip your deck over.  
* Institute a shared turn.  
* Win the game (unless there are any effects preventing you from winning the game).  
* Turn off any effects that are preventing you from winning the game.  
* Now win the game.  
* Draw a card.

# Infinity Gems
*Set: Black Order*  

**Owned By**  
Each of the six Infinity Gems has an "Owned by..." power which lets you play it for free on the appropriate character. For example, The Mind Gem can be played for free on The Grandmaster. You may notice that some of these powers refer to characters that aren't yet part of the game. Weird, right?

**We’re All Weirdos Here** lets your Supporting Characters Team Attack even if they don’t share a team affiliation and even if they’re in different rows. If there’s at least one melee attacker and at least one ranged attacker in the same attack, then the attack itself is both a melee and a ranged attack. Note: Each character must still legally be able to attack the defender.

# [Iron Monger](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu1-034.jpg) (MC)

The owner of a character is the player who brought that card to the game, regardless of which side that character is currently on. So Iron Monger’s **Steal Idea** power will trigger when a character that an enemy player “owns” gets recruited, whether that enemy player recruited it themselves or if you used Iron Monger’s **You Had a Great Idea, Tony** power.

# [Juggernaut](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BOM-001.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*  

Juggernaut is so big and powerful it’s almost impossible to beat him physically. Fortunately (for his enemies) he’s vulnerable to other kinds of attacks. This is represented on his card by his **It’s Gonna Take Something More to Stop Me!** power, which allows enemy players to spend an *Energy* ("Atom"/"Blue") to weaken him. Note: This works just like any other super power – except an enemy player can only use it once per turn during their Main Phase. And keep in mind special locations like Avengers Mansion can’t be used by an opponent on Juggernaut’s power.

**Underworld Boss**  
The Kingpin Supporting Character has a Super Power where he takes over as your main character. When this happens, your former Main Character becomes a Supporting Character and remains in the game. It can still gain XP and Level Up, but you don’t lose the game if it gets KO’d. Instead, you now lose the game when Kingpin gets KO’d.

Kraven has a Reaction super power. These types of super powers work a little differently than normal super powers. Reaction powers trigger when a certain condition is met (in Kraven’s case, it’s “when an enemy supporting character appears”). When that happens you can pay a (Skill/"Red"), and if you do, you put three -1/-1 counters on that character. You can use a Reaction super power at any time, as long as its trigger condition is met. However, like other super powers, you can only use it once per turn.

# [Legacy](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HER-012.jpg)
*Set: The Herald*  

Legacy can pay for **Nega-Bands** by spending either a (Might/"Green") or Negative Zone Location. Spending a Negative Zone means turning a Location named Negative Zone face down in your resource row or discarding one from your hand.

When you make a **Prediction**, secretly write down the name of two characters; an attacker and a defender. The names don't have to be characters in play at the time Mad Thinker uses the super power. When a character with the attacker's name attacks a character on your side with the defender's name (even in a team attack), cancel the combat. Then make another **Prediction** about the same turn, but this time you'll have a lot more data! You can make a maximum of two **Predictions** from each use of the super power.

When Mandarin gets KO’d, you’ll remove him from the game, shuffle your Behind the Camera pile, and randomly put one of the three cards there into your hand. 

This represents who Mandarin really is – lowly actor or deadly warlord. Leave the Behind the Camera pile face down – it’s important that your opponent doesn’t find out who the Mandarin really is until you’re ready to show them.

# [Mastermind](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV2-014.jpg)
*Set: Crossover vol. 2*  

When Mastermind appears, you'll create a Tactics pile made of any number of other Masterminds you have in your deck and hand. (Note: You don't have to put every Mastermind from your hand and/or deck into your Tactics pile.) Tactics piles are public. When Mastermind gets attacked, you mach choose to play a random card from your Tactics pile. If you do, follow the instructions under its Tactic. Then put the card into your KO pile. When Mastermind leaves play, you'll leave your Tactics pile where it is. A player can only have one Tactics pile at a time. Later, if Mastermind appears on your side again, and you can (and want to) add more Tactics from your hand or deck, add them to your existing Tactics pile. Note: One of Mastermind's Tactics sets an attacker's ATK to 0 this combat. That character can still gain ATK later in the combat.

# [Mattie Franklin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/WEB-011.jpg)
*Set: Webheads*  

If Mattie is in your deck you can bring a Gift pile, which must include one of each of the five Gifts: Death, Immortality, Knowledge, Madness, and Power. When Mattie uses **The Gathering of Five** choose five different characters on  your side with different names. At least one of these characters must be one of your Main Characters. Then randomly assign one of the five Gifts to each of them. If you don't have at least five characters on your side with different names (or you don't have a Main Character on your side), Mattie can't use **The Gathering of Five**.

The Gift of Death will instantly KO its assigned character. The other four grant new abilities to their assigned characters (some good, some bad). Gift cards are not actually in play. Their cards are just play aids to remind everyone what new abilities each character has gained. If a character leaves play its Gift will no longer affect them (even if that character reenters play).

# [Maximus](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-018.jpg)

**Usurp the Throne** lets Maximus KO another player’s Main Character and take over being that player’s Main Character. However, if they don’t currently have a Main Character, Usurp the Throne won’t do anything.

# [Mephisto](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-053.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

At your own risk, you may offer a **Deal with the Devil**. Here's how it works:

* The **Deal** must involve at least two elements.  
    * For example, the offer can't be "I draw ten cards."  
* There can only be one offer for the **Deal** - this is a "take it or leave it" situation.  
    * Mephisto hates negotiation.  
* The **Deal** can only involve game effects.  
    * For example, you can't offer money.  
* The **Deal** must be able to resolve immediately.  
    * Nothing that affects later turns or games.  
* All parts of the **Deal** must resolved simultaneously.  

Here are a few exemplar **Deals**:  

 -  "I draw five cards an you draw ten cards."  
 - "Wound your main character and put a supporting character from your hand onto your side."  
 - "You choose a character on your side and a character on my side and we stun them both."  
 - "I discard my hand and you lose the game."

# [Might Makes Right](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-016.jpg)
*Set: Black Order*  

In this Arc, we are playing around with how players can use locations besides super powers. In addition to cards like Nebula (who has a keyword power which requires spending a (Might/"Green)), each Issue will have a Plot Twist and Special Location that allow their main characters to have some pretty powerful effects on the game. A few things about these Plot Twists and Special Locations.

* They are not super powers.  
* Your main characters ust be face up to pay for them.  
* Your main characters can use a "Wild" Special Location from their team to pay for them.  
* These cards are neutral, so just like any other neutral cards, they can be in Loyalty decks.  
* The Special Locations don't count as location swith a specific power symbol (for powers like Black Widow Main Character's Level Up power **Red in Her Ledger** or ZZutak's **Paint to Life**).

# [Mimic](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HAM-005.jpg) (MC)
*Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.*  

Mimic’s **Absorption History** represents three characters that he’s copied powers from. In game terms it’s a pile that includes exactly three Main Character cards, one Level 1, one Level 2, and one Level 3. They can only be from the Illustrated Universe and they must have three different names (they can’t share a name through AKA). For example, you could have Cyclops Level 1, Dutch Level 2, and Spider-Man Level 3.

During setup when you reveal Mimic as your Main Character, you’ll also reveal the Level 1 character in your Absorption History. Mimic gains its Keyword and Super Powers only when the game begins. When Mimic becomes Level 2, you’ll reveal the Level 2 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Powers and loses the powers of the Level 1 character he was previously copying.

When Mimic becomes Level 3, you’ll reveal the Level 3 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Powers and loses the powers of the Level 2 character he was previously copying.

**Note:** While **Absorption History** is a Keyword and can technically be turned off by certain effects, turning it off doesn’t affect Mimic’s ability to use the pile (it’s locked in from the beginning of the game).

# [Mirage](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/NEW-010.jpg)
*Set: New Mutants*   

Mirage’s **Create Illusion** power lets you put a basic location from your hand into your resource row. Note that the new resource won’t generate any recruit points on the turn it appears. This is because recruit points are only generated at the start of your Recruit Step, which happens before you can recruit characters like Mirage.

*Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.*  

**I Can Predict Your Every Move** can temporarily reduce the ATK/DEF of a character while in solo combat with Mister X.For example, if a character with a printed ATK/DEF of 4/4 has three +1/+1 counters it is currently 7/7. However, while in solo combat with Mister X, itsATK/DEF counts as 4/4.

# [Mole Man](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-033.jpg) (MC)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Mole Man can **Tunnel** beneath enemy resources. If there are any enemy Locations, he must tunnel under those first. If there are none, he can tunnel under a face-down resource. When he **Tunnels**, remove him from the game and place him beneath the card he is tunneling under. At the start of your next turn, put him back onto your side and if the card he was under was a Location, turn it face down. If it was already face down, KO it.

If he is beneath a Location and it gets turned face down (including by being used for a super power) or leaves play, put him into your back row. If he is beneath a face-down resource and it leaves play, put him into your back row.

# [Mr. Black](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/PRD-008.jpg) (MC)

**Enhanced Bio-Mask** 
Mr. Black’s super power allows him to attack a face-down (hidden or stunned) character. Treat it as a regular attack (both players can play Plot Twists, Power-Up, etc.), but keep in mind the face-down character’s powers are turned off and its Team Affiliation is not available for things like playing a Plot Twist. 

When Mr. Black and the defender strike each other:  
* Mr. Black can get stunned as normal.  
* A hidden character can get stunned as normal. (Wound it and change its orientation from ready to exhausted.)  
* If Mr. Black’s strike would stun an already-stunned character, wound it instead. Note: A stunned character can’t be stunned (including by having its DEF reduced to 0 or a direct “stun” effect).

*Set: Sinister Syndicate*  

**Hallucinogenic Gas**  
Mysterio can use his special effects expertise to make any plot twist seem like a (Sinister Syndicate) plot twist. Here are the two in this set:

* Putting the Team Together  
* Sinister Six

When you play a plot twist as a copy of a (Sinister Syndicate) plot twist, ignore everything that’s printed on it, and pretend you just played one of the (Sinister Syndicate) plot twists. You can use any plot twist this way, regardless of its printed team affiliation or timing restriction. For example, you could play an (Avengers) **Combat** plot twist during your Build Phase as a copy of Putting the Team Together.

^(Source: Rule insert)

## [Mysterio](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SYN-008.jpg) (SC)
*Set: Sinister Syndicate*  

**Holographic Projector**  
Plot twists without team affiliations can be played  regardless of the team affiliations you have on face-up characters on your side. So Mysterio’s power means you can play any plot twist in your hand even if you only have, say, (Sinister Syndicate) characters on your side.

# [Mystique](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/LEG-067.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Legacy*  

**Identity Theft**

When she does this, remove her from the game and put the new character into play in the same orientation (ready/exhausted) she was in. Move all counters from her onto the new character, applying any effects (such as Freeze) to the new character. 

Playing with friends, you can choose to transform into any character in your collection, but if you’re playing in a tournament, you must select three Main Character options when you build your deck. You must set them face-down next to your unused Level 2/Level 3 characters. (You don’t need to show them to your opponent.)

**Atlantis Rises** adds a new row to your side, between your back row and your resource row, for the rest of the game. A player can’t have more than one Atlantis row on their side. Atlantis works just like your front and back rows (you can move characters there during your Formation Step, for example) with the following exceptions: 

* Characters in Atlantis can’t attack.  
* They are ‘protected’ by faceup characters in your front row and back row.  
* They can’t be attacked unless each character in your front and back rows is face down.

Her **Revenge!** power works the say way, but for Thanos, of course.

When Nebula gains a power via **Tomorrow is Mine to Sculpt**  she will keep it for the rest of the game. (Although cards like Cosmo or The Nullifier can still turn it off.)

**A New Order Exists Within the Universe** checks to see if an enemy character shares at least one team affiliation with a main character on its side. If the main character has no team affiliation, then no supporting characters on its side can share a team affiliation with it.

# [Pixie](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-008.jpg) (MC)
*Set: The Utopia Battles*  

**Souldagger** causes a character to lose each modifier it gained during combat. A modifier is an effect that modifies the game. There are two types of modifiers – 

A one-shot modifier does something immediately and then is done. Example: “Put two +1/+1 counters on a character.”

 A continuous modifier has an ongoing effect on the game, which may or may not have a duration. Example: “Choose a character to get +2/+0 and **Lethal** this combat.” 
 
When Pixie uses **Souldagger**, it will cause an enemy character to lose any continuous modifiers that are applying to it. (It won’t stop any one-shot modifiers because it’s impossible for there to be any one-shot modifiers happening while you use **Souldagger**.) 

**Half-Fairy** will give Pixie an XP when any character (including an enemy) pays an (Energy/"Blue"). This includes when a character uses an (Engergy/"Blue") Super Power, or choosing to spend an (Energy/"Blue") when you play the Plot Twist **Sacred Ground**.

Some characters are known by more than one moniker - like Power Man, who says **AKA Luke Cage**. He counts as having both names, which means you can use a Luke Cage supporting character to Power Up Power Man, and vice versa. It also means they both count as the same person for the purposes of the Uniqueness rules.

Power Man loves a good party, especially if he wasn’t invited. His **Crash the Party** power counts each enemy power, even if there are multiple instances of the same power. But remember face-down characters lose their powers so he won’t count their powers.

# [Professor X](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/NEW-005.jpg) (MC)
*Set: New Mutants*  

In this set the Professor gets a whole new main character, and this time he goes up to Level 3. (Note: This new Professor X can’t level up into the old one from The Marvel Battles set and vice versa. A main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork as it does.) 

Professor X’s **Graduation** power lets you turn an (X-Men) supporting character into the main character version of that character. (Once it’s become a main character it can level up normally. Professor X is a really good teacher.)

This allows you to have any number of main characters in play at once. However, Professor X is still your MAIN main character – if he gets KO’d you’ll lose the game. (Your other main characters getting KO’d won’t cause you to lose the game.)

The new character uses a physical supporting character card but erases its name, team affiliation, and game text and powers and replaces them with the name Fire Man, the (Brotherhood) team symbol, and the Creature keyword. (Which means it can’t have equipment.) When it’s KO’d or otherwise leaves play the card will go back to counting as the character printed on it.

# [The Reality Gem](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-020.jpg)
*Set: Black Order*  

You can use this Gem to turn cards in play face up. If you choose a stunned character this counts as recovering it. If you choose a hidden character, it counts as un-hiding it. If you choose a face-down location, it will turn face up. If you choose any other type of face-down resource (including an Infinity Gem), it will remain face down. (It should be revealed to each player to prove that it's not a location). 

You can also use the Gem to turn cards in play face down. If you do this to a ready character, it counts as hiding it. If you do it to an exhausted character, it counts as dazing it (i.e. stun it but it doesn't gain a wound). 

If you do it to an equipment, that equipment will stay equipped but its powers are temporarily turned off. It will turn face up again when the characters on that side would recover. If you do it to a location or face-up Infinity Gem, it will turn face down.

# Scarlet Spider
## [Scarlet Spider](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SPF-003.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Spider-Friends*  

Before he was the Scarlet Spider, the man who would become Ben Reilly was created from Peter Parker’s DNA to be a perfect clone. So in the game he actually starts off as a different “Spider” hero until his true self is revealed (once he reaches Level 2). Here’s how it works: 

Your Spider Web is a new out-of-play pile that includes up to one copy of every other Level 1 main character with “Spider” in its name. (Currently this includes Spider-Man from The Marvel Battles expansion, \* Spider-Man \* from Monsters Unleashed, and Spider-Man and Spider-Woman from this Issue.) 

Your Clone Pile is another out-of-play pile. It starts empty but during the game you’ll put characters from your Spider Web into it. 

Before the game begins, when each player reveals their main character, you’ll reveal the Scarlet Spider. Then instead of putting him on your side during setup, you’ll put a character from your Spider Web onto your side. 

When that character would become Level 2, you’ll instead transform it into Level 2 Scarlet Spider. (It will keep its counters, any effects on it, and its ready/exhausted and face-up/facedown orientation.) Then put the Level 1 main character he started the game as and the Level 1 Scarlet Spider main character into your Clone Pile. 

Once he’s Level 2, if he would be wounded, there’s a chance it was just a clone body instead: reveal a random card from your Clone Pile. If you reveal Scarlet Spider, he’ll get wounded as normal – they found you! But if you reveal someone else, he doesn’t get wounded (although whoever was revealed goes back into your Spider Web.)

# [Secret Hideout](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SFO-016.jpg)
*Set: Spidey-Foes*  

**Family is a Source of Weakness** lets your (Sinister Syndicate) Main Character take a **Hostage**. If you have any Secret Hideouts in your deck, you must bring a Hostage pile, which includes one ore more *different* (Spider-Friends) Supporting Characters with the **Friends and Family** keyword.

When you play Secret Hideout, one of your Main Characters takes a **Hostage**. Choose a character from your Hostage pile and put it beneath the Secret Hideout as a **Hostage**. Your Main Character gets the Keyword Power granted by that Hostage *while that Main Character is in your front row*.

For example, if you take Mary Jane hostage, your Main Character will gain **Pounce** while it's in  your front row. (It doesn't have to be protecting anyone.)

When that Main character gets stunned or leaves play, turn the Secret Hideout face down and set the **Hostage** aside. (It doesn't go back to your Hostage pile.) Similarly, if an effect turns the Secret Hideout face down, set the **Hostage** aside. Once the **Hostage** card is no longer beneath the Secret Hideout it also stops granting its Keyword Power.

It's possible for the same Main Character to have multiple Hostages (one for each Secret Hideout you play while you have that Main Character). 

Note: A **Hostage** is never actually in play. It's either in a Hostage pile, beneath a Secret Hideout, or set aside (after leaving a Secret Hideout).

*Set: Spider-Friends*  

**I Can and Will Fight You**
This issue introduces the powerful Alien Symbiote version of Spider-Man. But as they say, with great alien power comes great alien… danger. While the symbiote does make him stronger, he must remove it or it will quickly be game over. In the comics, when Spider-Man fights off the symbiote, it splits off from him as a separate entity. In the game, when Spider-Man sheds the symbiote, it splits off from him as a separate card. When this happens, Spider-Man will become Level 2 and now wears a cloth version of his black costume and the Alien Symbiote will look for a new host. (Note: Spider-Man Level 2 has one less Health – this represents losing the strength of the symbiote.) 

When a character with the Alien Symbiote is turned face down but isn’t KO’d, just keep the equipment token face up and ready, just like when it’s equipped to a face-up character (it doesn’t exhaust or turn face down). And remember, the symbiote is a jealous entity – it can’t be destroyed or removed from its host (at least until the host leaves play).

If you remove exactly one **Update** he gains (Flight) and (Range) until he leaves play. If you remove exactly two **Updates**, put two vitality counters on him. If you remove exactly three **Updates**, put twelve +1/+1 counters on him.

You can remove the same number of **Updates** more than once. For example, if you remove the two **Updates** for a second time, Spider-Man will get two more vitality counters.

Note: **Update** counters aren't removed from Spidey when he gets turned face down. However, they are still removed when he leaves play.

This Spider-Man, from the Ultimate Universe, is our first character to share a mantle with two other people! (Miles Morales and the main Marvel Universe's Peter Parker.) In this comics, this Peter died... but then came back to life because the **Oz Formula** that gave him his powers also granted him immortality. For the game, this means when Peter is KO'd, you won't lose the game immediately for not having a main character. You'll have until the end of your next turn to bring him back when a Supporting Character with the **Friends and Family** keyword appears on your side. In this case, put him back onto your side with wounds equal to his (Health) minus 1. (With the **Oz Formula** mechanic, Peter can continue fighting for those he cares about.)

Second, during your Build Phase, if a character with **Spider-Verse** is in your hand, you may put it onto your side.

# \* [Star Lord](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-006.jpg) \*
*Set: Galactic Guardians*  

Kitty Pryde becomes Star-Lord when the original Star-Lord is otherwise employed. So she has *s around her name, meaning she shares the "mantle" with Star-Lord, himself. The sharing of the mantle means both characters can be on a side at the same time because they're different beings, just with the same name. So you don't KO either because of the uniqueness rules and they can't power each other up.

Note that although this card represents her joining the Guardians of the Galaxy she's still an X-Men at heart, so she has both team affiliations.

Her **Intangibility** power lets her strike characters while they're in a player's hand. This is uncanny. A couple things about this: 

* She can strike any number of 0 DEF characters (or characters with * DEF).  
* She can strike characters who normally couldn't be struck by her while on a side (like Bulletproof characters) because those powers aren't active while the character is in a hand.  
* It doesn't matter how much (Health) a struck character has, it gets discarded.

**Schemes and Dreams**  prevents you from drawing cards during your Draw Phase, including your normal draws plus effects like Genius. However, if Thanos is face down at the start of your turn, Schemes and Dreams will be turned off. This means you can draw cards during your Draw Phase, however you can't search for a card.

**My Quest Begins** counts each card that enters your hand from your deck. So if you draw three cards, that would be 3 XP.
  
**The Universe Will Now Be Set Right**  has a 50-50 chance of removing each character on each side from the game. If this removes a players last main character, that player ;oses the game. If this removes each player's last main character (including Thanos, himself) then the Thanos player wins the game. (This is similar to how if the final two main characters KO each other in combat, the player whose turn it was wins.)

Jane Foster becomes Thor when the original Thor shirks his responsibility. She has \*s around her name, meaning she shares the "mantle" with Thor himself. This means both characters can be on a side at the same time because they're different beings, just with the same name. So you don't KO either because of uniqueness rules and they can't power each other up. When Thor is ready to start being "the" Thor again, Jane gracefully demurs. 

To represent this, her **There Must Always Be a Thor** power can only search for a card named "Thor" (with no \*s ) or with **AKA Thor** (like Odinson). It can't get a copy of herself.

# [Wyatt Wingfoot](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-014.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

**Self-Awareness**  
Wyatt knows he is in a  **Card Game**, and he wants to play too! So when he appears, and until he leaves play, he gets his own hand and resource row.  **Note:** His hand counts as being part of your hand, and his resource row counts as being part of your resource row.

Here’s how it works:

*   At the end of your Draw Phase, Wyatt draws two cards into his part of your hand. (Keep these cards separate from the main part of your hand.)  
    *   **This is the only way to add cards to his part of your hand**. If another effect would add cards to your hand, they always go to the main part of your hand, never to Wyatt’s part of your hand.  
    *  All other effects that affect your hand work as normal.  
        *   For example, if you are forced to ”discard a random card”, you must randomize all the cards in your hand, including Wyatt’s part of your hand.  
* At the end of your Resource Step, Wyatt may play a resource from his hand into his part of your resource row. (Keep these resources separate from the main part of your resource row.)
    *   **This is the only way to add resources to his part of your resource row**. If another effect would add resources to your resource row, they always go to the main part of your resource row, never to Wyatt’s part of your resource row.  
* At the end of your Recruit Step (after you’ve spent your normal Recruit Points to play cards from the main part of your hand, and any leftover Recruit Points go away), you gain 1 Recruit Point for each resource in Wyatt’s part of the resource row. You can only spend these Recruit Points to play cards from Wyatt’s part of your hand.  
* Characters and Equipment you play from Wyatt’s part of the hand work as normal once they are on your side. (Once they’re in play, it doesn’t matter if they came from your main hand or Wyatt’s part of your hand.)  
* You can play Plot Twists or power-ups from Wyatt’s part of your hand as normal.  
* You can spend Locations in Wyatt’s part of your resource row or discard them from Wyatt’s hand to generate power symbols normally.  
* When Wyatt leaves play, remove the cards in his part of your hand and resource row from the game. (Characters and Equipment played from his part of your hand stay in play.)

**Note:** If Wyatt gets moved to another player’s side, remove all the cards in his part of your hand and resource row from the game. Now Wyatt will draw extra cards and play extra resources for that player.

# [X-23](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/NEW-006.jpg) (MC)
*Set: New Mutants*  

X-23 is one of the toughest mutants around. So tough in fact that she only has a Level 1 main character. She can’t level up and she doesn’t care.

# [Xander](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-015.jpg) (SC) 
*Set: The Buffy Battles*  

When Xander hides, turn him face down but in the ready orientation. Remove all +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters and Equipment from him. A hidden character doesn’t count as being stunned, but it still can’t attack or defend, it doesn’t protect anyone behind it, and loses its powers. It still keeps its other information like name and team affiliation. If a hidden character gets stunned somehow, change it to the stunned orientation (face down and exhausted). A hidden character will turn face up the same time your stunned characters would recover.
