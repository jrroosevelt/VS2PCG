# Card clarifications and FAQs

The following card-specific information is a culmination of clarifications, rule changes, and FAQs from various sources. After each item (or series of items), there's a "Source" indicator that specifies whether the item came from:
* Rule inserts from the set
* An official FAQ doc published by Upper Deck Entertainment (UDE FAQ)
* An official rule change, clarification, or errata
* A community source, such as Facebook or Discord. (Some of these have been officially approved by UDE and, if so, are noted in the source citation). 

**Note**: There have been some minor editorial liberties taken (not all are exact quotations from the main source). These changes are mainly cosmetic or made to help understand context outside of the rulesheet and do not fundamentally change the intent of the original text.

# [Abomination](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu1-033.jpg)
*Set: MCU Battles*
  
Abomination’s **Give Me a Real Fight!** Power forces a player’s first attack to include a specific character and the defender must be Abomination. However if either that character can’t attack or Abomination can’t be attacked, the effect does nothing. Also, the player can choose not to attack at all on their turn.

# [Adam Warlock](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-001.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Galactic Guardians* 
 
At [Level 1](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-001.jpg), if Adam Warlock gets KO'd by getting stunned, **Prepare for Rebirth** will cause him to gain an XP and become [Level 2](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-002.jpg) while in the stunned position. (If a power like Hex prevents him from leveling up, he'll remain at Level 1 but still heal his wounds.)

*Q:   If I don’t use his Emerge power, will he recover normally during my next Recovery Phase?*

A: Yes. But he’s huge! Spend that MIGHT and start bashing with him right away, man!

# [Agatha Harkness](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-013.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

If Agatha appearing on your side KOs an Agatha that was already on your side (due to uniqueness), **Ancient Sorceress** will count the Agatha that was KO'd.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Ajax](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-012.jpg)
*Set: Deadpool & Friends*  

Ajax's **Pain Tolerance** power says he can only be KO'd by fatal wounds at the end of a turn. A character has fatal wounds if it has at least as many wounds as its health. So Ajax can have any amount of wounds but won't actually get KO'd until the end of a turn.

# [Alcatraz](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HAM-019.jpg)
*Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.*  

Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.  
When the character in “prison” turns face up, the player who used Alcatraz decides which row on its original side it goes back to.

# [Alicia Masters](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-009.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Here's an example of how her **Neo-Realistic Sculptor** works. The Thing is on your side, who has 10/6 ATK/DEF. While Alicia is also on your side, his ATK/DEF become  10/10.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Alien Symbiote](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SPF-021.jpg)
*Set: Spider Friends*

>If a character that is equipped with the Alien Symbiote gains an equipment card, put the Alien Symbiote in the KO pile.

The text on Alien Symbiote says that it cannot be KO'd but the One-Equip rule in the rule book will override this text if the character is equipped with another equipment card.  Cards must explicitly (not implicitly) override game mechanics and this was ruled that it was not intended to override the one-equipment rule.




# [Angel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/RES-001.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Resistance*  

When Angel levels up, he transforms into [Archangel](#wiki_archangel). When this happens, he keeps his orientation (ready/exhausted, face-up/face-down), all of his counters, and any effects on him. Also note Archangel doesn’t have a Level 1 version. The only way to becomehim normally is to start the game with (Resistance) Level 1 Angel as your Main Character.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Angel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-001.jpg)/[Angelus](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-028.jpg) (MC) 
*Set: The Buffy Battles*  

Level 1 Angel and Angelus can transform between each other. However, when you build a deck you must choose either Angel or Angelus to be your starting Main Character. (You must lock in your decision at the time you build your deck, not after you see what Main Character your opponent is using.) When Angel transforms into Angelus or vice versa, he keeps his orientation (ready/exhausted, face up/face down), all of his counters (including XP), and any effects on him.

^(Source: Rule insert)
# [Angela](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-015.jpg)
*Set: Galactic Guardians*  

**An Angel From the Heavens** makes it difficult for Angela to be solo attacked. An attacker must have (Flight) or (Range) (or both) to solo attack her. 

When Angela opens a **Bridge to Heven**, you must put each revealed character onto your side. This may cause some characters to be KO'd due to the uniqueness rules.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Annihilus](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FRI-001.jpg)
*Set: The Frightful*

**Lord of the Negative Zone** allows you to include up to two Negative Zone Locations in your deck. (If Mister Fantastic is in your deck your Invention pile will also include its usual two Negative Zones.)

**The Living Death That Walks** grants 1 XP for each of the listed actions. So if Annihilus attacks, strikes, and stuns a defending character, but somehow doesn't wound or KO it, he will gain 3 XP.

When Annihilus levels up, you'll shuffle his Level 1 card into your deck. While it's in your hand you may reveal it for his **Continuous Rebirth** power. (You can also discard it to Power Up Annihilus. Put the discarded card into your Level Up zone, which is where his Level 2 card started the game.

# [Anya](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-018.jpg) 
*Set: The Buffy Battles*

Her **Newly Human and Strangely Literal** power ignores all stat increases including +1/+1 counters. It doesn’t remove the counters – they just have no effect this turn.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Archangel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/RES-002.jpg)
*Set: Resistance*  

**Violent** means that he strikes Supporting Characters with double his ATK.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Ardina](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HER-008.jpg)
*Set: The Herald*  

**Clone of the Silver Surfer** refers to the "card title" Silver Surfer. This means the name at the very top of the card must be Silver Surfer. **AKA**s don't count.

^(Source: Rule insert)

---
If Ardina appears via some mechanism other than being recruited (such as being brought along by Lockjaw or Legacy), you do not have to pay the additional cost of wounding Silver Surfer.

# [Armor](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-018.jpg) 
*Set: The Utopia Battles*  

**Psionic Exoskeleton** is a combat power, but its effect lasts for the rest of the turn.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Arnim Zola](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-001.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Crossover* 
 
**ESP Box** takes effect once the game starts and lasts the whole game (even while Arnim Zola is stunned, after he levels up, and even after he is KO’d). You can play any Equipment as a Supporting Character, regardless of whether you have a character with a matching team affiliation. When you play one as a Supporting Character, it’s no longer an Equipment. If it has a power that references “Equipped Character,” it is its own equipped character. When the card leaves play it will go back to being an Equipment. You may still play an Equipment normally and equip it to one of your characters (including on an Equipment that you played as a Supporting Character). 

When Arnim Zola enters **A New Robot Body**, your new Equipment-turned-Main Character will have ATK/DEF equal to its cost, 1 (Health), Swarm, and it will count as its own “Equipped Character,” just like with ESP Box. When that body gets KO’d, it can use this power again to jump into another robot body, and so on. Note: if you want to use a Wild Special Location to pay for this power, it must match the team affiliation of the Main Character using this power.

# Avalanche
## [Avalanche](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BOM-009.jpg) (Brotherhood)
*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*  

Avalanche’s **Sustained Seismic Waves** power gets stronger each time he uses it. However, if you play a new copy of Avalanche later, the super power on that copy will start over.

## [Avalanche](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-022.jpg) (Resistance)
*Set: The Utopia Battles*  

**The Big One** KOs basic Locations with different types. The types are:

* Energy (Blue)  
* Intellect (Yellow)  
* Might (Green)
* Skill (Red)  
* Alien (Space)
* Humanity (Earth)


^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Awesome Android](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-042.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

If there are no other face-up characters in play, Awesome Android's ATK/DEF become 0/0 (and he gets stunned).

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Baron Mordo](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/LEG-048.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Legacy*  

Baron Mordo can revert a main character back to level 1 until your next turn. When the effect wears off, the character goes back to whatever level and card it was before.  

^(Source: Rule insert)

Q: If I **Hypnotize** a Ripley #8 L2 that started the game as Sister Ripley, which Level 1 Character does she become? Sister Ripley or Ripley#8 level 1?

A: Ripley #8 Level 1. A character will always become the level one version of what it is.  

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel)

---
Q: Does **Hex** prevent a **Hypnotized** character from turning back into Level 2 at the start of my next turn?

A: No, Hypnotize creates a modifier with an expiration that temporarily makes a character its Level 1 version. When that modifier expires it becomes its Level 2 version again, and this is not considered Leveling up.

# [Beast](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/DFX-010.jpg) 
*Set: The New Defenders*  

Note that **Acrobatic** doubles his DEF whether he is attacking OR defending.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# \* [Bishop](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/LEG-015.jpg) \*
*Set: Legacy*  

**Energy Transference**  
This power refers to (Energy/"Blue") super powers.This counts for any super power with the appropriate symbol in its cost (even if it also has other symbols in its cost).

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Black Bolt](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MMU-037.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Monsters Unleashed!*  

Black Bolt’s Super Powers use the Amplify ability. When you use a Super Power, if you discard a Location (instead of turning it face-down in your resource row), you get the Amplify text. Previous Amplify Super Powers grant an effect to begin with but a larger effect if you Amplify it. Black Bolt’s powers only grant an effect if you Amplify them.

# Black Cat
## [Black Cat](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/aff-028.jpg) (MC)
*Set: A-Force*

Q: If Satana is in play and Black Cat attacks a defender and uses **Cross their Path** to Daze that character, is it KO'd by Lethal?

A: Daze counts as stunning, but Lethal was changed to work when a wounding a defending supporting character. Since Daze does not wound, lethal is not applied.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel)

## [Black Cat](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SPF-012.jpg) (SC - unaffiliated)
*Set: Spider-Friends*  

**Personal Loyalty**  
Black Cat has often wavered between being a hero and a villain. In the game she doesn’t have a team affiliation and is neither Good nor Evil… until she’s on a side (she is neither Good nor Evil while she is in your hand, deck, or KO pile). Then if Spider-Man is your main character, he has a good influence on her and she’ll ferociously fight alongside her partner. But if he’s not your main character, she’ll go back to slinking around as a criminal.

# [Blackheart](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-048.jpg)
*Set: Defenders*

Q: [Even the Odds](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-076.jpg) targeting Blackheart. He resets to a 4/4 for the rest of the combat, yes? His power does not turn on until the next combat he becomes involved in?

A: Even the Odds creates a modifier that overrides or suppresses any other modifiers modifying ATK/DEF for THAT COMBAT. Any modifiers that with a duration longer than the the combat will "turn on" after the combat has passed.

# Black Panther
## [Black Panther](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/COS-001.jpg) (MC - Illustrated)
*Set: Cosmic Avengers*  

For Black Panther's **Passing Down the Knowledge**, whenever more than one card is put into your KO pile at the same time, he still only gains 1 XP.

^(Source: Rule insert)

## [Black Panther](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu2-003.jpg) (MC - Photo)
*Set: MCU Heroes*  

Black Panther Black Panther’s **Vibranium Weave Suit** power prevents him from being struck for the entire turn including the combat he’s currently in.

## [Black Panther](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu2-014.jpg) (SC)
*Set: MCU Heroes*  

Black Panther Black Panther’s **Bulletproof** power prevents enemy characters with [Range] from striking him. It doesn’t matter if Black Panther is attacking or defending, or if it’s a melee attack or ranged attack. As long as a character has [Range] it can’t strike him.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# Blob 
## [Blob](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-003.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Crossover*  

If Blob strikes a character and his **Boing!** power causes that character to strike itself, you add Blob’s ATK to that character’s own ATK to see if it’s enough to stun it. 

**Immovable Object**  
If Blob moves for any reason (including during your Formation Step or because another effect moves him), he will be prevented from gaining an XP. At the end of Blob’s first turn of the game, he will gain an XP if he didn’t move that turn.

^(Source: Rule insert)

## [Blob](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BOM-015.jpg) (SC)
*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*  

Blob’s **Stuck in His Stomach** power represents a melee attacker getting temporarily trapped by Blob’s flab. This effect will take place even if Blob gets KO’d in the attack. (Just imagine him unconscious lying on top of the attacker.)
 
And his **Bounced Off His Belly** power represents projectiles getting bounced back at any ranged attackers. Note: In the event that Blob somehow had (Range) he would not strike back using his own ATK because Bounced Off His Belly’s strike back would override his normal strike back.

# [Boomerang](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SFO-008.jpg)
*Set: Spidey-Foes*  

**Specialized Boomerangs**  
Boomerang can "throw" a different Boomerang each turn at one front row and one back row enemy. You can choose a front row character on one side and a back row character on a different side. If there are no enemy front row characters you can just choose an enemy back row character (and vice versa).

# [Break the Fourth Wall](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-019.jpg)
*Set: Deadpool & Friends*  

This plot twist really lets you get in the game. When you put a “Me” token onto your side, you get to choose a team affiliation and your age will determine your ATK and DEF. You’ll have Leader because you’re still in charge of your team, but don’t worry – if you get KO’d you don’t lose the game because you’re also still a player. We figure you have more questions about all this, so let’s dive in. 

* **How do you prove your age?** If you’re at a tournament you’ll need an ID with a birthday. If you don’t have one, we’ll just pretend you’re 11.  

* **Does this card have different power levels for different players depending on their age?** Yes.  

* **Isn’t that ageist?** Great question. Think about it this way: Yes.  

* **What happens if I’m 29 and tomorrow’s my birthday, but then it turns to midnight in the middle of the game?** You’ll become a 3/0 and get stunned.  

* **Isn’t that kind of stupid?** Play faster next time.

* **I feel like you’re not taking this seriously.** That’s not a question.

# [Buffy](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-003.jpg) (MC) 
*Set: The Buffy Battles*  

Buffy’s **Save the World. A Lot.** power lets her Slay an Evil Main Character. If she does and it’s the last enemy Main Character in play, you win immediately! But if something goes wrong or there are other enemy Main Characters left, Buffy will get KO’d at the end of the turn.

# [Build a Better World](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/aff-025.jpg)
*Set: A-Force*

Q: If I need to play two of the same color locations for an ability, can I play a plot twist in between to turn a location face up? Or do I need to use two different locations to pay the cost?

A: When you pay a cost, you have to pay the entire cost, and you can not play any other powers or plot twists while you are in the middle of playing a power.

# [Bullseye](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-027.jpg) (MC)
*Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.*  

When Bullseye uses **Perfect Aim** it will give him ATK until it’s equal to the defender’s DEF. But if the Defender gains or loses DEF later in the combat, that won’t affect Bullseye’s ATK.

**Everything’s a Weapon**  
With **Everything’s a Weapon**, you’ll put the top card of your deck into your KO pile before you choose which enemy character to apply the effect to.

# Cable
## [Cable](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/small/NEW-001.jpg) (MC)
*Set: New Mutants*  

Cable’s **Advanced Cybernetics** power gives all your equipment everywhere the (X-Men) team affiliation for a turn. This makes it so you can play any equipment even if you don’t have a character that matches the equipment’s printed team affiliation.

^(Source: Rule Insert)

---

Q: Another question about Cable and his super power **Advanced Cybernetics**. If I pay the yellow, then declare an attack can I equip Combistick onto him during the combat? Basically does that super change change all team symbols and what not on the card to X-men?

A: Though the equipment itself gets the X-Men affiliation the text still requires the character to be a Predator in order to equip it as a PT in combat.

Q: Question about Cables LV2 ability **Time Travel** is that super power basically like a board reset? I know it says KO'ed pile, hand, and removed, and all other cards on there side, meaning cards in play, resource row? Just wanted to double check on the cards in there side part.

A: Yes. Only wounds, levels, and equipment on MCs remain as-is.

## [Cable](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-045.jpg) (SC)
*Set: The Marvel Battles*

Q: How does his **Ultimate Soldier** power work?

A: When you activate his power while he’s attacking, it means the defender will get stunned at the end of the combat even if the attackers’ ATK isn’t as much as the defender’s DEF.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

---

Q: What happens if I use his power but the combat gets canceled?

A: Cable’s power has no effect since the combat didn’t come to its natural conclusion. It doesn’t matter if the combat was canceled due to a card effect like **Think Again** or due to all of the attackers getting stunned.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

---

Q: What happens if he’s team attacking and I use his power, but then he gets stunned before the combat resolves?

A: His power will still trigger and stun the defender even though Cable himself got stunned before the combat resolved. This is because once an effect resolves and creates a modifier, it is independent from the source that created it.

A: Yes.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

Q: If Cap team attacks with one other character, but in the middle of combat the other character gets stunned by a Plot Twist or Super Power, but Cap still stuns the defender, will he get an XP?

A: No. Once the other character gets stunned mid-combat, it stops being a team attack and becomes a solo attack so Cap won’t get the XP. For Cap to get the XP it must be a team attack at the end of the combat.

# \* [Captain Marvel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/COS-012.jpg) \*
*Set: Cosmic Avengers*  

His **Cosmic Awareness** allows him to ask an opponent one concrete question about their hand. The answer has to be truthful. In a casual setting, use the honor system, or a bystander to help out. In a more formal setting, you can ask a judge. Good examples of questions to ask are: 

* "Do you have any Plot Twists in your hand?"  
* "Do you have any Fin Fang Fooms in your hand?"  
* "Do you have a 7 cost card in your hand?"

## [Chameleon](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SYN-007.jpg) (SC)
*Set: Sinister Syndicate*  

**Master of Disguise**  
Chameleon does copy the **Sinister Six** keyword from your main characters who have that keyword. It doesn’t do anything for him in the game because he’s not a main character – he just wants to feel like a real part of the team.

**Primordial Power**  
(Infinite) ATK means the Champion will always have enough ATK to stun a defender and his DEF will always be high enough to avoid getting stunned by a defender's strike. Although if somehow, the defender also has infinite ATK and DEF, then both characters will get stunned. (In other words, infinite ATK is treated as equal to infinite DEF which results in a stun. It's maths.)

Q: If I remove Copycat to Singularity's **Pocket Dimension** with two other characters, when all 3 return does Copycat get all the powers of the other two supporting characters she returned with?

A: If a modifier's duration would expire before it is created, then it is never created. Basically if two supporting characters appeared at the same time, they would both cause her to trigger, but also both cause the other to expire since they appeared simultaneously.

Q: If I remove Copy Cat and Sabretooth to Singularity's **Pocket Dimension**, will she gain Sabretooth’s powers when they appear?

A: Yes

>If multiple characters "appear" at once, Copycat is unable to copy any of them.

With the reveal of Copycat, the question arose on her interaction with [Singularity](https://i.imgur.com/3vlwcdR.jpg).  Specifically, if multiple characters (other than Copycat) appear at once, which SC's powers, if any, does Copycat inherit?  The ruling is that if multiple triggers occur simultaneously for Copycat, she will not gain any powers.  The reasoning is that she only gains powers "until another supporting character appears on your side."  This means that when multiple characters appear at once, the duration of her effect has already expired by the time it resolves.  From head judge: "if a modifier’s duration would cause it to expire before it is created, then the modifier is never created."  Ultimately, Copycat needs only a single character to appear in order to resolve as intended.

With **All Bark, No Flight** each power lost grants 1 XP. So if a character loses three powers, Cosmo gains 3 XP. **Note:** (Flight) and (Range) are both keyword powers. A character must lose a power and remain face up in order for Cosmo to gain an XP. Losing powers because a character turned face down doesn't count.

*Set: The Utopia Battles*  

You will draw two cards with **They’ll Follow Him** if you have one Supporting Character that is both (Brotherhood) and (X-Men). Similarly, a multi-affiliation character can satisfy more than one of the requirements of **The Squad I’ve Put Together** and **Trust the Plan**. 

Note: **Trust the Plan** will only put three +1/+1 counters on a character even if you’re using it to satisfy two or more of the requirements. And even if you have several characters of all three required affiliations, Trust the Plan can only ever put three counters on three characters maximum.

# [Daredevil](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-002.jpg) (MC)
*Set: The Defenders*  

**Radar Sense**  
Daredevil and Rhino have effects that allow an enemy player to spend a (Skill/"Red") or (Intellect/"Yellow") to do something. In this case, they can use a Training Ground or Academy to pay for the effect, but not a special Location like Fisk Tower.

**Protector of Hell's Kitchen**

Q: If I attack Daredevil with Mary Walker (Typhoid Mary) and I put a -1/-1 counter on Daredevil and one on the only character he's protecting which happens to have 1 defense (like Black Widow), KO'ing her, does Daredevil gets an XP?

A: The turn player decides the order per page 9 of the rule book under "Timing." Daredevil's level up power has an intervening "if" clause, which means the condition must be true when it triggers AND when it resolves. So if the turn player decides to resolve Mary Walker's power before Daredevil's power, Daredevil will not get an XP because he won't be protecting anyone once his level up power resolves. On the other hand, if the turn player decides to resolve Daredevil's power before Mary's then Daredevil will gain an XP.

# [Dark Beast](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-042.jpg)
*Set: Utopia Battles*

Q: Dark Beast SC2. "Pay 2 less to play evil equipment." Outside of Darkhold, how does one define "evil" equipment?

A: [Good or Evil](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/good_or_evil) affiliations are typically based on the [Team Affiliation](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_team_affiliation) of the card. 

For example: Power Loader would be Good because it has The Company team affiliation, but Omega Machine would be Evil because it is H.A.M.M.E.R. affiliated.

However, for this specific question it should be noted that Darkhold is neutral. It does require you to have a Marvel character, but Marvel isn't a Team Affiliation and doesn't make the card Good or Evil. So Darkhold - even though it can only be equipped to an Evil character -  is not Evil itself (and would *not* benefit from Dark Beast's power).

*Set: Crossover*  

**Deconstruct the Universe**  
When Deconstructs the Universe, an entire concept of the game gets removed for the rest of the game (even if she leaves play). If, as a result of this, the wording of a card’s power is unclear, the part that is unclear does nothing. Here’s how removing each concept works: 

* **+1/+1 and -1/-1 counters:** Remove all of those counters from the game. Remove the phrases “+1/+1 counter” and “-1/-1 counter” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause these counters to enter the game in any way 
 
* **Equipment**: Remove all Equipment cards everywhere from the game. This includes all sides, decks, hands, KO piles, and Equipment that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Equipment cards but don’t currently count as Equipment (such as a face-down resource or an Equipment that has become a character via Arnim Zola’s   
**ESP Box** ). Remove the term “Equipment” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Equipment to enter the game in any way.  

* **Keyword text:** Removing this concept doesn’t affect **Flight** and **Range**. Remove all Keyword text from the game, including powers that “can’t be turned off”. Remove the term “Keyword” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Keyword text to enter the game in any way.  
 
* **Levels:** All Main Characters everywhere become Level 1 if possible. Remove all remaining Level 2 and higher Main Characters from the game. Remove all Level Up Powers and XP from the game, and the terms “Level” and “XP” from all card text. Ignore any effects that would cause XP or a Level 2 or higher Main Character to enter the game in any way.  

* **Plot Twists:** Remove all Plot Twist cards everywhere from the game. This includes all decks, hands, KO piles, and Plot Twists that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Plot Twist cards but are not currently Plot Twists (such as a face-down resource). Remove the term “Plot Twist” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause a Plot Twist to enter the game in any way.  

* **Super Powers:** Remove all Super Powers from the game. Remove the term “Super Power” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Super Powers to enter the game in any way.

*Set: Deadpool & Friends*

> Hiya kids, it’s your old pal, Deadpool. Guess what? I’m the First character in the game to go all the way to Level 4. There’s probably a break-the-fourth-wall joke in there somewhere, but I haven’t found it yet. Anyhoo, the powers that be want me to tell you that even though I’m now on two different main character cards, the (X-Men) and (Underworld) versions of me can’t level up into each other.  
> 
> It’s because a main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork. And guess what? I don’t mean to brag but I’m actually a designer now. You know all the cards in this set that you love? That’s right -- I designed them. (All the cards that you hate were designed by those other two dummies.) Designing stuff is sweet. You can pretty much do whatever you want.  
> 
> I like designing so much, I wanted to do some while I was in the game too. My new main character can **nerf** stuff, **errata** stuff, and even **ban** stuff. Check it out:  

**I'm Taking Over From These Idiot Designers**  
  
* **Nerf:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks, and KO piles are 0/1 with 1 and nothing can ever, ever change that.  

* **Errata:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles lose and can’t gain powers (including (*Flight*) and (*Range*)). 
 
* **Ban:** Name a character and choose a number. Put all supporting characters with that name on enemy sides into their owner’s hands. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles have a cost equal to the chosen number and nothing can ever, ever change that. (Except banning it again. You know the old saying: “If you really, really hate a card, ban it twice.”) Any effects that would increase or decrease what an enemy player pays to recruit a banned card are ignored.  

Here are some quick tips:  

* If you steal a character with one of those effects the effect will stop because it’s not an enemy character anymore. Yay! However, if it goes back to an enemy side the effect will turn on again. Boo!  

* When you Ban a character, you can name any number you want. Even a million bazillion. Try it, it’s fun!

* If someone tries to tell you that this isn’t really how nerfing, errata-ing, and banning works, you just take your katana and do some "development” on them, if you know what I mean.

## [Deadpool](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-031.jpg) (MC- - X-Men)
*Set: The Marvel Battles*

Q: If I use **Merc With a Mouth** to make my Gambit or Dazzler Lethal, will they KO a character by using their Super Powers to stun them?

A: No, for Lethal to work a character with Lethal needs to wound a Defending supporting character during Combat. Dazzler and Gambit use their Super Powers during the Main Phase.

**Man, There's Noone Left to Kill**
Q: If I’m playing with 3 or 4 players, do ALL enemy characters have to be stunned for Deadpool to gain an XP?

A: No. At the end of your turn, if any enemy player has no face-up characters, Deadpool will gain 1 XP. (If two or more players have all stunned characters, Deadpool still only gains 1 XP.)

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

---

Q: What’s going on with his **Oh, there’s someone! Hi there!** power?

A: If all of an enemy player’s characters are stunned, Deadpool can attack that player. If the attack stuns the player, that player is KO’d and is out of the game. (The same way as if his Main Character has been KO’d.)

Q: What does “the player counts as a supporting character” mean?

A: It means that if Deadpool is attacking you, you can play Plot Twists that would help a supporting character to increase your stats or otherwise survive the combat.

Q: What if an effect puts a +1/+1 or -1/-1 counter on me while I’m defending against Deadpool?

A: It goes on you. If this puts you to 0 DEF, you’ll get stunned (and KO’d). If it makes your stats better, that could help you survive this attack and will stick around to help you if he attacks you again on a later turn.

Q: What if I get KO’d?

A: You’re out of the game, the same way as if your Main Character got KO’d. (You do not actually lose consciousness.)

Q: After Deadpool uses his **Oh, there’s Someone! Hi there!** power, can he team attack a player?

A: No, the other characters don’t know what a player is.

Q: If I have both Silver Sable and Deadpool, can they both enter a team attack with my Main Character?

A: No, For a team attack to be legal, all characters have to be on the same team or legal to attack with each other. Deadpool & Silver Sable are not on the same team and can only team attack with Main Characters, not each other.

# [Death](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-001.jpg)
*Set: Black Order*  

Death is **Amortal** which means:

* She has no level (She is beyond such mortal trappings).  
* She starts with her card that has infinite health. (Her other card has 8 health, also known as sideways infinity.)  
* She can't be face down. If she would be turned face down, switch her with her other card instead and leave it face up. For example when she gets stunned, instead of turning her face down, switch her with her other card which will remain face up. She still suffers other effects from the stun such as losing the +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters, gaining a wound, and becoming exhausted.  
* If she would be hidden, instead switch her with her other card which will remain face up and place her in the ready position.  
* Amortal can't be turned off.
 
Since Death doesn't turn face down, she can be stunned multiple times in a single turn. However, if she takes fatal wounds she's not really defeated. She's just temporarily lost interest in this mortal battle. (The player who was using her is defeated, though.) 

**Note:** While death is technically two cards, you could slip her into a single clear card sleeve with her cards back to back. Then when she would turn face down, you can just flip her to her other "side."  

**Mistress of the Infinity Well** allows each player to draw an extra card each time you draw cards. For example, when you draw your usual two cards during your Draw Phase, you'll draw an extra one. And if you have a **Genius** in play that lets you draw a card, you'll draw an extra one then, too.

Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur each have two different team affiliations. Moon Girl is on the Inhumans and Devil Dinosaur is on the Monsters Unleashed team. But both of them are also on the Moon Girl/Devil Dinosaur team. This allows them to Team Attack together or with members of their respective teams.(Keep in mind all members of a Team Attack must share at least one team affiliation.)

# [Devil Slayer](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/DFX-009.jpg)
*Set: The New Defenders*  

His **Shadow Cloak** lets him attack hidden and stunned characters. Treat it as a regular attack (both players can play Plot Twists, Power Up, etc.), but keep in mind the face-down character’s powers are turned off and its team affiliation is not available for things like playing a plot twist.

When Devil-Slayer and the defender strike each other: 

* Devil-Slayer can be stunned as normal.  
* A hidden character can get stunned as normal. (Wound it and change it from ready to exhausted.) 
* If Devil-Slayer’s strike would stun an already-stunned character, just wound it instead.

Q: I have Devil-Slayer. My opponent has a stunned character in their back row and a face-up character in their front row. Can Devil-Slayer attack the stunned character in the back row? I'm asking because the comp rules state that a stunned character "can't be protected".

A: No. Devil Slayer still has to follow all the other legal attack rules. He doesn't have flight so he can't ignore the front row.

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Doctor Doom's **Time Platform**  does something very odd. It shuffles a card into a deck face up. We suggest you close your eyes when shuffling a deck with a face-up card in it. In a tournament, you can always ask a judge to shuffle the deck if necessary. Once the deck is shuffled, where the card is in the deck is public information, so we also suggest you turn it 90 degrees so it's sticking out of your deck.

# [Dramatic Entrance](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/aff-050.jpg)
*Set: A-Force* 

Q: Do "Appears" powers work when character are brought into play with Dramatic Entrance? I'm not sure because it says, "put into play."

A: It does not matter how a character enters play. If it goes from not being in play, to being in play, it has "appeared" whether that is from recruiting, or some other effect putting it into play.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

Q: How does Dramatic Entrance work if I bring a Loki 7 drop SC into play with it? Does Loki draw me a card if it was the first PT I played that turn? Or since it wasn't in play, it doesn't grant me the benefit? If it doesn't, then does the next PT I play that turn trigger Loki's Schemer power?

A: If you bring in Loki SC with Dramatic Entrance, Schemer will not trigger. At the time you PLAYED the plot twist, Loki was not in play. Once he is in play, he does not look back in time and see that you played a plot twist. Also if you play another plot twist, Schemer will still not trigger because it is not your first plot twist played this turn.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

Q: If you dramatic entrance a Wasp or Ant-man can you just Shrink the combat?

A: The triggering event for Shrink is "When [this character] gets attacked for the first time each turn..." and by the time you play Dramatic Entrance, you are past the point which Shrink would trigger.

^(Source: FB Post - UDE Approved)

Q: Can you bring a character in with Dramatic Entrance that is already on the field? If so, does it KO the one on the field?

Q: If I use Dramatic Entrance to put Adam Warlock into play as the new Defender, what happens since he comes into play stunned due to his **Evolutionary Cocoon**?

A: The original defender is still removed from combat, but since Adam enters play stunned, he can not become the defender, so he will enter play and he will be unable to become the defender. Since there is no defender, the combat will end, at which point, the delayed trigger will trigger and KO Adam Warlock.

Since this is a "transformation", the Lizard will keep any counters and effects that Dr. Connors had (including a wound counter since he was just stunned).

You can include up to the usual four copies of Lizard in your deck as well as bring up to four copies for your Lizard pile (one for each copy of Dr. Cur Connors in your deck). If you don't have any Lizards in your Lizard pile, **The Monster Within** won't do anything.

Q: If I activate L2 Dr. Strange's **Mass Transmutation** power can I target a character with +1/+1 counters as well as a character with -1/-1 counters and switch them to their opposite counter types?

A: Yes, **Mass Transmutation** states "For each one, remove it's +1/+1 counters and put that many -1/-1 counters, or vice versa" so in this case you would be able to state which characters you're choosing as well as what counters are to be removed and which ones are to replace for each character.

Q: Can I choose Elektra to be discarded with Helmut Zemo's **Sow Distrust**?

A: While Elektra is in your hand, you do not control a Main Character. Therefore, she is a valid choice.

Q: If I activate Kingpin's **Underworld Boss** while Elektra is in my hand, what happens to Elektra?

A: She is demoted to a Supporting character no matter what zone she is in. From the rules: "Some effects may promote a Supporting Character to Main Character and vice versa. Unlike most modifiers, these modifiers can apply to a Main Character in any zone (or side) and continue to apply to the character even if it changes zones."

# Emma Frost
## [Emma Frost](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-005.jpg) (MC) 
*Set: The Utopia Battles*  

**Keeper of Law** allows a character to strike an additional time in a combat. The character can strike two different characters once each (if they’re being team attacked, for example), or they can strike the same character twice. In the latter case, add the character’s ATK together for each strike and then compare it to the enemy’s DEF. 

Emma’s power can be used any number of times each turn. So if a character ends up being allowed to strike 3, 4, or more times, it works as above. Any number of strikes can be combined against an enemy or split amongst multiple enemies.

Q: Even the Odds targeting Blackheart. He resets to a 4/4 for the rest of the combat, yes? His power does not turn on until the next combat he becomes involved in?

Q: Hello, a question about the Perfect Organism and Even The Odds. If I use the ability to strike with double of the attack, (**This Thing is Huge! It's...It's Big!** / **Fearless**) and my opponent plays Even The Odds, what happen?

A: This **Thing is Huge! It's... It's Big!** does not actually modify the ATK. It is modifying how hard it strikes during combat resolution. Normally when you strike, you strike an equal amount to your ATK. This power (and the Daredevil one) changes the rules of the game so that you are striking with double that amount, or triple with Amplify.

# [Evil Deadpool](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-005.jpg)
*Set: Deadpool & Friends* 
  
Made from Deadpool’s discarded body parts that fused back together into a new person, Evil Deadpool gains XP whenever you discard a character. This includes powering up as well as any effect that causes you to “discard” a card (whether you or your opponent controls the effect).

**Merc With an Evil Mouth**  
Evil Deadpool loves being Evil. That’s why he can grant Evil characters on your side the new keyword, Evil Lethal. Evil Lethal works just like regular Lethal except after you KO the supporting defender you laugh evilly. (If you’re unable to laugh evilly you’ll still resolve the effect as much as possible and KO the defender.)  

**It's Like You, But Eviler!**  
Evil Deadpool’s Level 2 super power puts Good characters into play but turns them Evil and adds the word “Evil” at the beginning of their name. Changing their name DOES affect the uniqueness rules. For example, it would allow you to have “Iron Man” and “Evil Iron Man” on your side at the same time. However, you would not be able to add “Evil” to regular Deadpool because then his name would be “Evil Deadpool” which is the same name as your main character. And Evil Deadpool hates Deadpool anyway.

# [Facehugger](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/ALN-052.jpg)
*Set: The Alien Battles*  

**Facehuggers and Capturing Characters**   
If you have [Ovomorphs](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/small/ALN-035.jpg) in your deck (the eggs that make Facehuggers), you’ll use the Facehugger Pile. 

* The Facehugger Pile includes three Facehugger token characters and one Extended Incubation card. These cards start the game out of play. (If more than one player is using Ovomorphs, they will each use their own Facehugger Pile.)   
* When an Ovomorph is ready to Hatch, reveal a random card from your Facehugger Pile.  
* If you reveal the Extended Incubation card, the Ovomorph doesn’t open yet. Shuffle the Extended Incubation card back into your Facehugger Pile.  
* If you reveal a Facehugger token character, KO its Ovomorph, put the Facehugger into your Back Row, and it captures an enemy supporting character. (It can capture a face-up or stunned supporting character.)  

“Capture” is a new game action that means:  

 - Remove the Captive card from the game, but keep any wound counters on it.  
 - Put the Captive card next to (or underneath) its Captor to make it clear who its Captor is.  
 - When the Captor leaves play, put its Captive back into play stunned in its owner’s back row.  
 - You may pay an (Alien/"Space") at the start of your Build Phase. If you do, KO the Facehugger and put its captive into its owner’s KO pile. Then you may put an (Xenomorph) character from your hand into your back row. (This represents the new Xenomorph bursting out of the captive’s chest.)  
 - Note: Put the KO’d Facehugger token back into your Facehugger Pile.

Some characters have a **Bond** with another character. This allows them to be discarded from your hand to generate a Power Symbol for that other character’s Super Powers. You can do this for that character’s Main or Supporting Character. 

Example: You want to use the Falconer Supporting Character’s **Bait and Switch** Super Power, which costs (Skill/"Red"). You may discard a Falcon Drone from your hand to pay for the Super Power. If a character with Bond is used to generate a Power Symbol for a Super Power with Amplify, the Amplify text will apply

Falconer starts the game with a Falcon Drone from your deck on his side. The Falcon Drone still counts toward your 60 cards when you build your deck. 

His Level Up Power, **We’re the Game**, triggers whenever an enemy player reveals one or more cards. Some effects that would grant 1 XP this way are when a player reveals their hand, when a player reveals one or more cards from the top of their deck, or when a player reveals the cards they draw (due to a Falcon Drone).

*Set: The Frightful*

When Fallen One strikes Galactus or Thanos, **Fallen Herald** will stun them. However, if Fallen One's strike already had enough ATK to stun them, **Fallen Herald** won't do anything. (In other words, **Fallen Herald** won't cause Galactus or Thanos to become stunned twice in one combat.)

# [Fantastic Four](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HER-019.jpg)
*Set: The Herald*  

**The Core Four** requires you to have at least one of the listed characters face up on your side. You can then give any character on your side (not just one of the core four) a combination of four total ATK/DEF. For example, you could give a character +0/+4, +1/+3, +2/+2, +3/+1, or +4/+0. **Note:** You can't use negative numbers here such as +5/-1.

Fin Fang Foom and Leviathon Hydra are each able to attack multiple enemies at once. When they do, they will strike with their full ATK against each defender, and the defenders will total up their ATK to strike back.

>Fin Fang Foom cannot attack a row if any character in that row is an illegal target

For example, if [Xenomorph Ambusher](https://i.imgur.com/XHtrRFS.jpg) was in the back row, Fin Fang Foom cannot declare an attack on that row due to the Ambusher's "Camouflage" keyword.

^(Source: Official Clarification)

---

> If an effect would remove a defender from the attack when Fin Fang Foom is the attacker, that defender remains removed from the attack even if it did not change rows

This ruling was made to clarify how Fin Fang Foom would interact with cards such as [Dramatic Entrance](https://i.imgur.com/bit8aVS.jpg) or [Uncanny Defense](https://i.imgur.com/unboeQ6.png) that remove a defender from the combat, but may still result in the defender occupying the row that Foom is attacking.  The ruling is that the defender removed by one of these cards is no longer part of the combat.

>The [Massive](https://i.imgur.com/e0WOynY.png) keyword does not combine with special attack declarations such as attacking a [Machine](https://i.imgur.com/Fg27kSk.jpg) or attacking a Location.

Attacking a machine is a special type of attack declaration that can only be done if all conditions are met. (No face up characters in the same row as the machine and the attacker can otherwise legally make an attack on that row.)  This was compared to attacking a location with the keyword on [The Thing That Crawls By Night](https://i.imgur.com/U3yOlXN.jpg).  Attacking a row with Massive is Foom's normal attack mode and does not combine with these special attack declarations.  That said, if Foom attacks a row with a Machine in it, he will simply not strike the Machine.  Foom can choose to make a single target attack on the machine if the other conditions are met allowing him to do so.  This is the same as the power on [The Thing That Crawls By Night](https://i.imgur.com/U3yOlXN.jpg) where if an SC were to gain both powers at once, they could not attack multiple Locations in a player's row.  They would need to either attack the front or back row with Massive or attack a Location with the keyword "Nothing is Too Big For it to Attack!"

# [Franklin Richards](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-021.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Franklin is one of the most powerful beings in the multiverse. So powerful he has been able to, from a young age, create a **Pocket Universe**. Here's what happens when he does that:

* Move each Character other than Franklin to the side of the playing space. **They are now in a separate part of the game.**
    * A **Pocket Universe** has only front and back rows (no resource row).  
    * When the characters are moved to the **Pocket Universe** they stay in the same rows they were in in the original universe. They keep all their counters and their orientation (ready/exhausted; face up/face down).  
    * The **Pocket Universe** is still in the same overall game as the original universe. So cards don't "appear" or "leave play" when they move from the original universe to the **Pocket Universe** or vice versa.  
    * Cards in the **Pocket Universe** cannot attack or otherwise affect cards in the original universe and vice versa.  
    * The Uniqueness rules don't apply across the **Pocket Universe** and original universe. (For example, you could have a Human Torch in both Universes.)  
    * Note: Your hand, deck, KO pile, and out-of-game piles can be accessed in both the original universe and the **Pocket Universe** (more on this below).  
* Each player who has characters in a **Pocket Universe** will take a separate turn in that **Pocket Universe** after their normal turn (before the next player's normal turn, and including the turn Franklin creates the **Pocket Universe**).  
    * First take your normal turn. During this turn, ignore the **Pocket Universe**.  
    * After your turn is over, you then take a **Pocket Universe** turn. During this turn, ignore the original universe.  
    * The cars you play on a particular turn can only affect that turn's universe.  
* A **Pocket Universe** turn sequence is a little different than a normal turn, as follows:  
    * Start of turn  
        * Note that there is no Draw Phase.  
    * Recovery Phase  
    * Formation Step  
        * Note that there is no Build Phase because there are no Recruit Points or resource rows in the **Pocket Universe**.  
    * Main Phase  
        * This works just like a "Normal" Main Phase in regard to combats.  
        * You can play Plot Twists from our hand to affect a **Pocket Universe**.
        * You can discard Locations from your hand to generate a power symbol in the **Pocket Universe**. (Since the **Pocket Universe** has no resource row, there are no locations to turn face down to generate a power symbol.)  
        * You can discard characters from your hand to Power Up characters in a **Pocket Universe**.
        * When a character is KO'd in a **Pocket Universe**, they go to the normal KO pile. Similarly, if a character leaves play due to an effect, it works the same as if the character were still in the original universe. For example, if an effect returned teh character to its owner's hand, it would go to that hand as normal.
    * End of turn
* If there is more than one **Pocket Universe** in the game, each player will take their normal turn first, then a **Pocket Universe** turn for each **Pocket Universe** they have characters in, starting with the first **Pocket Universe** created, then the second, etc.
    * Cards in one **Pocket Universe** cannot attack or otherwise affect cards in another **Pocket Universe**.
* When Franklin leaves play, the characters from each **Pocket Universe** he created pop back into the original universe part of the game, in the same rows and with the same orientation they were in their **Pocket Universe**.
    * If this leads to more than one character with teh same name on your side, KO all except one (your choice).

You can recruit a character with **Dimensional Wristwatch** directly from your deck: Announce you're recruiting them from your deck, search your deck for the character, shuffle your deck, and then recruit them (pay its cost and put it onto your side). 

If a character with the chosen name gets put back into your deck somehow it will regain **Dimensional Wristwatch** while it's in your deck.

**Ticket to the Multiverse** lets Ghost-Spider jump from your game to a neighboring game. You must have permission from all players in that game before Ghost-Spider can make the jump into their game.

If no one else is playing near you or you don't have permission to move Ghost-Spider, then remove her from the game until the start of your next turn.

When Ghost-Spider enters another game or gets removed from the game set aside all her counters and Equipment. She will reappear in her original game with those counters and Equipment.

If Ghost-Spider enters anotehr game of Vs. System 2PCG, you decide which player gains control over her. She can attack, gain counters, get stunned, get KO'd, etc., just like in her original game. However, no matter what happens she will go back to her original game at the start of your next turn. When she jumps back, any counters, Equipment, etc. that she gained in the other game will be removed.

* They are not super powers.  
* Your main characters ust be face up to pay for them.  
* Your main characters can use a "Wild" Special Location from their team to pay for them.  
* These cards are neutral, so just like any other neutral cards, they can be in Loyalty decks.

Goblin’s **Bag of Tricks** allows you to discard Locations to make him more powerful in combat. If this causes Goblin to strike “before each other character,” this means he strikes first even if any of the characters have, for example, a power like Ferocious. And if two Goblins are in combat with that ability, they’ll strike each other at the same time.

As he does not have one. Short of it, you can discard any character you like.

Hulk’s **Puny Weapons Can’t Hurt Hulk** power means that Lethal wounds (and even Evil Lethal wounds) won’t KO him. This also includes, but is not limited to, things like Gamora’s Godslayer Blade and MCU Drax’s Finger on Throat Means Death.

# [Hydro-Man](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SFO-006.jpg)
*Set: Spidey-Foes*  

**Fluid Tactics** lets you convert ATK from a **Combat** Plot Twist into DEF (or vice versa). For example, if you play a Plot Twist that gives him +3 ATK, you could have him gain +3 DEF instead. It has to be all or nothing. You can't play a Plot Twist that gives him +3 ATK and convert it into +2 ATK and +1 DEF.

Note: +1/+1 counters granted from Plot Twists can't be converted by **Fluid Tactics**.

# Impersonating Powers
*Set: Utopia Battles*   

Several characters have powers that impersonate other characters. These powers turn off immediately if the character they’re impersonating ever shows up. It doesn’t matter if the character that’s being impersonated is face up or face down or what side they’re on. Either way they count as being on “a side” and will turn off the Impersonation power.

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

**Omnifarious**  
Impossible Man is three cards in one. He can be played as an Equipment, a Plot Twist, or a Supporting Character. Note that if he is an Equipment, his Equipment power has no name, so it can't be chosen by any effects that choose power names.

# [The In-Betweener](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV2-009.jpg)
*Set: Crossover Vol. 2*  

**Duality Itself** lets you put the In-Betweener onto your side between two turns of the game. You can even do this after an enemy player's first turn but before your first turn.

The In-Betweener couldn't decide exactly how much cost, ATK, DEF, and health to have so he ended up between two whole numbers. In most cases, his stats work like this. 1 ½ cost means you must pay 1 ½ recruit points to recruit him. So you will have ½ a recruit point left over. 4 ½ ATK means his strikes will stun a 4 DEF character but not a 5 DEF character. 3 ½ DEF means if he is struck with 3 ATK, he won't get stunned, but if he gets struck with 4 ATK he will get stunned. 2 ½ (Health) means 2 wounds won't KO him, but 3 wounds will.

# [The Infinity Gauntlet](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-017.jpg)
*Set: Black Order*  

While equipped, the Infinity Gauntlet allows you to turn any number of face-down Infinity Gem equipment in your resource row face up to show that you've "set" them into the Gauntlet. If a card with Infinity gets put into a KO pile from anywhere, you may shuffle it into its owner's deck. 

If the Gauntlet leaves play, leave the face-up Gems in your resource row as they are. However, you can no longer user their powers. If a character on your side equips the Gauntlet later in the game, those Gems will already be inset and its Wielder can use their power again.

**Infinite Power**  
This allows you to do anything you want for the rest of the game. Hera re some examples of things you could do:

* Put a +1/+1 counter on a character.  
* Take an extra turn.  
* Use a Build Phase power during your Main Phase.  
* Flip your deck over.  
* Institute a shared turn.  
* Win the game (unless there are any effects preventing you from winning the game).  
* Turn off any effects that are preventing you from winning the game.  
* Now win the game.  
* Draw a card.

# Infinity Gems
*Set: Black Order*  

**Owned By**  
Each of the six Infinity Gems has an "Owned by..." power which lets you play it for free on the appropriate character. For example, The Mind Gem can be played for free on The Grandmaster. You may notice that some of these powers refer to characters that aren't yet part of the game. Weird, right?

Q: If my opponent attacks my character and uses **Iron Fist Punch** and I play Shock to the System reducing Iron Fist's attack to 0, he does not strike to stun, correct?

A: In order to "strike" you must have at least 1 attack, so no, Iron Fist does not stun the character with his Iron Fist Punch.

# [Ironheart](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-014.jpg)
*Set: Crossover*  

**We’re All Weirdos Here** lets your Supporting Characters Team Attack even if they don’t share a team affiliation and even if they’re in different rows. If there’s at least one melee attacker and at least one ranged attacker in the same attack, then the attack itself is both a melee and a ranged attack. Note: Each character must still legally be able to attack the defender.

The owner of a character is the player who brought that card to the game, regardless of which side that character is currently on.

# Juggernaut
## [Juggernaut](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BOM-001.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*  

Juggernaut is so big and powerful it’s almost impossible to beat him physically. Fortunately (for his enemies) he’s vulnerable to other kinds of attacks. This is represented on his card by his **It’s Gonna Take Something More to Stop Me!** power, which allows enemy players to spend an *Energy* ("Atom"/"Blue") to weaken him. Note: This works just like any other super power – except an enemy player can only use it once per turn during their Main Phase. And keep in mind special locations like Avengers Mansion can’t be used by an opponent on Juggernaut’s power.

For info about **Unstoppable**, see Juggernaut SC.

## [Juggernaut](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-096.jpg) (SC)
*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*

Q: How does his **Unstoppable** power work?

A: You make a solo attack with him against a front row character, then during combat you activate his power. If he stuns the defender and survives the combat, you may then immediately make another solo attack with him against a back row character controlled by the same player. Leave Juggernaut exhausted and dive right into his second combat. You can attack a back row character this way even if there are still face up front row characters.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

---

Q: If I use Enchantress' **Go Forth My Champion** on Juggernaut, and then activate **Unstoppable** on his first attack on a front row character, does he exhaust for his second **Unstoppable** attack?

A: In the case of Juggernaut it says to immediately attack a back row character, so the game jumps right back into combat. When "blah" is attacked/attacks triggers will still happen, but the normal rules for checking the legality if the attack (exhausting the attacker, making sure they are not protected etc.) do not apply. So in the case of Juggernaut + Enchantress it would work like this:  
  
* Use Enchantress's power on Juggernaut.  
* Juggernaut attacks a front row character and immediately readies.  
* Juggernaut uses his Unstoppable super power.  
* Juggernaut stuns the front row character and survives.  
* Juggernaut immediately attacks a back row character without exhausting.  
* Assuming Juggernaut survives the second combat he will still be ready.

Q: I attack with my Unstoppable Juggernaut. My opponent's front row character Plays Dead. Do I still get to trample through or no?

A: If you use Play Dead on a defender, the combat is over. Since Juggernaut did not stun the defender, his ability will not trigger.

# Kang
## [Kang](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FRI-006.jpg) (MC)
*Set: The Frightful*

**Immeasurable Identities** makes all Kang Supporting Characters you own into Main Characters. This effect lasts the whole game, even if your starting Kang Main Character gets KO'd. And remember - as long as you have any Main Characters on your side, you don't lose the game.

^(Source: Rules Insert)

## [Kang](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FRI-009.jpg) (SC)
*Set: The Frightful*

If any number of Kangs are in your deck, **The Tomorrow War** lets you pick a single **Future Date** before players draw their opening hands during setup. A **Future Date** is represented by a whole number from 1-10. It counts as being that "Date" while you have exactly that many resources.

So if you pick 7 as your **Future Date**, Kang can only appear while you have exactly seven resources. (On the bright side, he's free.) Note: If you forget to pick a **Future Date** at the beginning of the game, the game acts as though you chose 10 as the Date. 

**Time Will Tell** sets Kang's base ATK/DEF to be equal to the **Future Date** you selected. It doesn't matter how many resources you currently have. **Time Will Tell** "locks in" when you select the **Future Date** before the game starts.

# The Kingpin
## [The Kingpin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-029.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Defenders*

Q: When I discard a Location card to use a Super Power does that give Kingpin an XP?

A: No, "appears" means to come into play from anywhere, so the Location has to be put into play. So playing one from your hand into your resource row or putting one into play from the top of your deck with Nick Fury would count. Discarding does not.

^(Source: FB Post - Kirk)

## [The Kingpin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-047.jpg) (SC)
*Set: The Defenders*  

**Underworld Boss**  
The Kingpin Supporting Character has a Super Power where he takes over as your main character. When this happens, your former Main Character becomes a Supporting Character and remains in the game. It can still gain XP and Level Up, but you don’t lose the game if it gets KO’d. Instead, you now lose the game when Kingpin gets KO’d.

^(Source: Rule insert)

Q: If Kingpin (SC) becomes my Main Character will Groot (my former MC) still be able to level down? And if so will he sill get XP later on?

A: Groot retains his powers and Level Up ability, and **We Are Groot** is a Super Power that puts him back to Level 1, so yes.

Q: I control lvl2 Professor X and 2 Underworld supporting characters. I (until end of turn) gain control of your Kingpin SC. I activate Kingpin's super power and he becomes my main character. I end my turn and return control of your Kingpin SC (my MC). You could hypothetically KO my entire board and be unable to KO my main character. What rules are there dealing with this?

A: You lose the game. More specifically, at the beginning of your next turn if your opponent controls your MC, you lose the game.

Q: Can I steal an opponent's Kingpin with Purple Man after they've used **Underworld Boss** to make him their MC?

A: If Kingpin uses **Underworld Boss** and becomes the MC, he is no longer an SC and effects that require an SC can not be used or played on Kingpin. In short Purple Man can NOT steal Kingpin once he becomes a MC.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

Q: If I activate **Underworld Boss** while Elektra is in my hand, what happens to Elektra?

A: She is demoted to a Supporting character no matter what zone she is in. From the rules: "Some effects may promote a Supporting Character to Main Character and vice versa. Unlike most modifiers, these modifiers can apply to a Main Character in any zone (or side) and continue to apply to the character even if it changes zones."

# [Kraven the Hunter](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SYN-002.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Sinister Syndicate*  

**Spring the Trap**  
Kraven has a Reaction super power. These types of super powers work a little differently than normal super powers. Reaction powers trigger when a certain condition is met (in Kraven’s case, it’s “when an enemy supporting character appears”). When that happens you can pay a (Skill/"Red"), and if you do, you put three -1/-1 counters on that character. You can use a Reaction super power at any time, as long as its trigger condition is met. However, like other super powers, you can only use it once per turn.

# [Lady Deathstrike](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/aff-046.jpg)

Q: When does Death Strike determine if Lady Deathstrike has survived the Combat if I bring her into combat with an MC with Dramatic Entrance? If she isn't stunned by the Attacking MC and activated Death Strike will the MC get 2 wounds even though Dramatic Entrance will KO her at the end of combat?

A: To survive combat means to be unstunned at the conclusion of combat resolution; The survival check/combat resolution is distinctly before end of combat effects triggering. So yes, the MC will get 2 wounds.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

---

Q: How does Lady's Deathstrike's Death Strike ability interact with Luke Cage's Impervious skin? would he negate both wounds?

A: Impervious Skin would not apply because it only prevents wounds from getting stunned, it does NOT prevent wounds given another way. The wound given by Lady Deathstrike's Super Power is NOT from stunning, it is given directly by the resolving effect.

Q: If Lilith KO's Mantis or Dormammu Are they removed from game, or do their own powers happen instead? (Mantis to the row, Dormammu shuffled into the deck.)

A: When multiple triggers happen at the same time, the active player chooses which happens first. If it's the Lilith player's turn they may choose to remove the KO'd character from the game first (and gain a Health). As soon as these characters change zones, any other modifiers are lost. If it's the Mantis or Immortal player's turn, they can choose their triggers to happen first and the Lilith modifier is lost and they are not removed from the game (also Lilith does not gain a Health).

*Set: The Frightful*

If the Maker is in your deck, you get to have the usual Invention pile, plus you can add up to five Equipment to it. They must be different cards (same name but different game text is fine) and can’t already have the Keyword  **Invention**. (You can also include copies of those Equipment in your deck if you like, and the copies in your Invention pile don’t count against them. For example, you can have a  **One of a Kind** Equipment in your deck and the same one in your Invention pile.)

**Note**: While the Maker (and only the Maker) can Invent those Equipment, you can still only play them if you meet their play requirements. For example, if the Maker invents a (Hydra) Cosmic Cube, you get to put it into your hand. But you still can’t play it unless you have a character with the Hydra team affiliation on your side.

# Mandarin
## [Mandarin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu1-046.jpg) (Photo)
*Set: The MCU Battles*  

Mandarin is really three potential characters in one. If Mandarin is in your deck you’ll need to bring your **Behind the Camera** pile with you which includes two copies of **Trevor Slattery** and one copy of **The Ten Rings**. When Mandarin gets KO’d, you’ll remove him from the game, shuffle your Behind the Camera pile, and randomly put one of the three cards there into your hand. 

This represents who Mandarin really is – lowly actor or deadly warlord. Leave the Behind the Camera pile face down – it’s important that your opponent doesn’t find out who the Mandarin really is until you’re ready to show them.

*Set: The Marvel Battles*

Q: Can I use a **Rebirth** power on the same turn I played a resource normally?

A: Yes. It’s essentially an extra resource.

Q: If a character with **Rebirth** gets KO’d by the Uniqueness rules (i.e. I play a second copy of Mantis) can I still use her Rebirth power?

A: Yes.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

---

Q: If an opponent steals my Mantis (using Professor X) and then she gets KO’d, who gets to use her **Rebirth** effect?

A: Whoever currently controls the card gets to choose whether to use the **Rebirth** effect. However, she can only be placed in the Resource Row of her owner. In the example, that will be you.

# Marvel Required (Equipment)
*Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs Hydra*   
 
This set includes four One of a Kind equipment cards – The Nullifier, Book of Vishanti, Darkhold, and Serpent Crown. Each of these has the (Marvel) symbol on its top right instead of a team affiliation. This means in order to play one, you must have a face-up (Marvel) character on your side. (The Marvel symbol is on the bottom of Marvel character cards.)

# [Mastermind](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV2-014.jpg)
*Set: Crossover vol. 2*  

When Mastermind appears, you'll create a Tactics pile made of any number of other Masterminds you have in your deck and hand. (Note: You don't have to put every Mastermind from your hand and/or deck into your Tactics pile.) Tactics piles are public. When Mastermind gets attacked, you mach choose to play a random card from your Tactics pile. If you do, follow the instructions under its Tactic. Then put the card into your KO pile. When Mastermind leaves play, you'll leave your Tactics pile where it is. A player can only have one Tactics pile at a time. Later, if Mastermind appears on your side again, and you can (and want to) add more Tactics from your hand or deck, add them to your existing Tactics pile. Note: One of Mastermind's Tactics sets an attacker's ATK to 0 this combat. That character can still gain ATK later in the combat.

# Match
*Set: The Utopia Battles*

Q: If Match strikes a Defender does he *only* put -1 counters on someone, or does he do counters *and* strike simultaneously?

A: When he strikes a Defender, his strike *is* the -1/-1 counters. These aren't applied, however, until the combat is resolved. So, let's say that his opponent is 4/4 and is in position to strike back. Both Match and the Defender would strike simultaneously. The Defender hits with 4/4, Match hits with his counters (which haven't yet resolved). Match would be stunned by the strike back, and then the Defender would be reduced to 0/0 with the counters and would also be stunned.

---

Q: Match's ability says, "If Match would strike a defender, put -1/-1 counters equal to his ATK on that defender instead." Does that mean this ability only applies when Match is attacking? (Not when he is striking back as a defender.)

A: Correct.

# [Mattie Franklin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/WEB-011.jpg)
*Set: Webheads*  

If Mattie is in your deck you can bring a Gift pile, which must include one of each of the five Gifts: Death, Immortality, Knowledge, Madness, and Power. When Mattie uses **The Gathering of Five** choose five different characters on  your side with different names. At least one of these characters must be one of your Main Characters. Then randomly assign one of the five Gifts to each of them. If you don't have at least five characters on your side with different names (or you don't have a Main Character on your side), Mattie can't use **The Gathering of Five**.

The Gift of Death will instantly KO its assigned character. The other four grant new abilities to their assigned characters (some good, some bad). Gift cards are not actually in play. Their cards are just play aids to remind everyone what new abilities each character has gained. If a character leaves play its Gift will no longer affect them (even if that character reenters play).

# [Medusa](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/aff-014.jpg)
*Set: A-Force*

Q: If you use Medusa's **Prehensile Hair** ability can that character be removed with Singularity? I know it says can't be moved but I am not sure if that just refers to front of back row.

A: "Can't be moved" only applies to effects that use the words move, pull, push and switch.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

---

Q: Can a defending character locked down by Medusa be replaced in the combat & moved with Uncanny Defense or Spiderman MC?

A: The Defender will be replaced with a new defender but the switching of places is defined as a move so they will both stay where they are because if one of the characters can't move for a switch, neither will.

Q: Can you have several opponents characters exhausted?

Q: Can a character who is affected by the **Prehensile Hair** ability be moved to another player's side? If they can, must they remain in the front row when moved?

# [Mephisto](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-053.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

At your own risk, you may offer a **Deal with the Devil**. Here's how it works:

* The **Deal** must involve at least two elements.  
    * For example, the offer can't be "I draw ten cards."  
* There can only be one offer for the **Deal** - this is a "take it or leave it" situation.  
    * Mephisto hates negotiation.  
* The **Deal** can only involve game effects.  
    * For example, you can't offer money.  
* The **Deal** must be able to resolve immediately.  
    * Nothing that affects later turns or games.  
* All parts of the **Deal** must resolved simultaneously.  

Here are a few exemplar **Deals**:  

 -  "I draw five cards an you draw ten cards."  
 - "Wound your main character and put a supporting character from your hand onto your side."  
 - "You choose a character on your side and a character on my side and we stun them both."  
 - "I discard my hand and you lose the game."

# [Might Makes Right](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-016.jpg)
*Set: Black Order*  

In this Arc, we are playing around with how players can use locations besides super powers. In addition to cards like Nebula (who has a keyword power which requires spending a (Might/"Green)), each Issue will have a Plot Twist and Special Location that allow their main characters to have some pretty powerful effects on the game. A few things about these Plot Twists and Special Locations.

* They are not super powers.  
* Your main characters ust be face up to pay for them.  
* Your main characters can use a "Wild" Special Location from their team to pay for them.  
* These cards are neutral, so just like any other neutral cards, they can be in Loyalty decks.  
* The Special Locations don't count as location swith a specific power symbol (for powers like Black Widow Main Character's Level Up power **Red in Her Ledger** or ZZutak's **Paint to Life**).

# [Mimic](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HAM-005.jpg) (MC)
*Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.*  

Mimic’s **Absorption History** represents three characters that he’s copied powers from. In game terms it’s a pile that includes exactly three Main Character cards, one Level 1, one Level 2, and one Level 3. They can only be from the Illustrated Universe and they must have three different names (they can’t share a name through AKA). For example, you could have Cyclops Level 1, Dutch Level 2, and Spider-Man Level 3.

During setup when you reveal Mimic as your Main Character, you’ll also reveal the Level 1 character in your Absorption History. Mimic gains its Keyword and Super Powers only when the game begins. When Mimic becomes Level 2, you’ll reveal the Level 2 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Powers and loses the powers of the Level 1 character he was previously copying.

When Mimic becomes Level 3, you’ll reveal the Level 3 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Powers and loses the powers of the Level 2 character he was previously copying.

**Note:** While **Absorption History** is a Keyword and can technically be turned off by certain effects, turning it off doesn’t affect Mimic’s ability to use the pile (it’s locked in from the beginning of the game).

[This card has received errata.](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rulings#wiki_mimic)

---

Mimic’s  **Absorption History**  does not allow you to copy any “setup” powers from the Level 1 Main Character in his Absorption History pile.

From the Absorption History rules:

>During setup when you reveal Mimic as your Main Character, you’ll also reveal the Level 1 character in your Absorption History. Mimic gains its Keyword and Super powers only when the game begins.

When the game begins, it is past the point when you would have needed to resolve any setup powers.

-   For example, Scarlet Spider’s  **Spider-Clone**  power takes effect during Setup. But since Mimic gains Scarlet Spider’s power once the game begins, it’s too late for it to affect anything.
-   Similarly, Mimic gaining the  **Sinister Six**  keyword from one of those characters won’t do anything.

There is one weird case we’re going to mention here since it includes cards from the latest story arc (First Family).

If Mimic has Doctor Doom (Level 1 or Level 2) or Mister Fantastic (Level 2) in his Absorption History, that will not grant Mimic an Invention pile. However, if you already have an Invention pile (because you have a supporting character  **Inventor**  in your deck) while Mimic is in an **Inventor** he will be able to access your Invention pile.

The Mimic Main Character is found in the Vs. System 2PCG: H.A.M.M.E.R. expansion.

Q: When using whichever lvl character from the **Absorption History** pile, which team affiliation does one use: Mimic's (H.A.M.M.E.R.) or the absorption power character's team?  

A: Mimic gains their powers, not team affiliations. Mimic is H.A.M.M.E.R. - it doesn't matter what his absorb guy is for any reason. That card isn't even technically in play.

When he **Tunnels**, remove him from the game and place him beneath the card he is tunneling under. At the start of your next turn, put him back onto your side and if the card he was under was a Location, turn it face down. If it was already face down, KO it.

If he is beneath a Location and it gets turned face down (including by being used for a super power) or leaves play, put him into your back row. If he is beneath a face-down resource and it leaves play, put him into your back row.

Q: Which side does Moloid check to determine the ATK boost?

When Mr. Black and the defender strike each other:  
* Mr. Black can get stunned as normal.  
* A hidden character can get stunned as normal. (Wound it and change its orientation from ready to exhausted.)  
* If Mr. Black’s strike would stun an already-stunned character, wound it instead. Note: A stunned character can’t be stunned (including by having its DEF reduced to 0 or a direct “stun” effect).

Q: Mystique and Green Goblin are out; Mystique attacks and uses her power to give her 4 ATK and she has enough to level up. Does she keep those 3 ATK she took from green goblin to make her a 9/7?

A: Yes. The vast majority of the time, the results of a resolving effect are "locked in" at resolution and even if the situation later changes, the modifier still applies. The only exception is if they use the word "While" which mean it is continuously looking for a specific variable to be true or false.  
  
Since this does not use "While" we know it is locked in at resolution. As long as the duration has not expired, any modifier affecting the Lvl 1 Mystique will continue to affect the Lvl 2 Mystique.  
  
In the example given by the OP, the +3 ATK gained by her Super Power would continue to apply after she is level 2.

Q: With **Masquerade**, Does Mystique gain that character’s base ATK, or their current attack including counters/modifiers/etc?

For example, if Spider Ham attacks Mystique while Madame Web is in his side, giving him 8/4, and Mystique uses masquerade, does she gain attack up to 6 (since this is spider ham’s base ATK) or does she gain attack up to 8 (since he has +2/+2 from madame web)? So would she gain 5 XP or  7 XP?

A: Mystique matches power including all modifiers, so she’d gain 7 attack. It would say “printed attack” if it worked the other way.

Q: What happens if Mystique has any +1/+1 counters when I use Impersonate?

A: Apply the +1/+1s after her stats change. For example, let’s say she has two +1/+1 counters and she Impersonate’s a 4/7 character. She’ll become 4/7 with two +1/+1 counters for an end result of 6/9.

*Set: The Predator Battles*

Q: Can I Daze a face down character with Net Launcher-equipped Gamora who has **Godslayer Blade** activated and KO the character?

A: Net Launcher allows you to use a super power that will Daze a character. This will allow for any stun triggers to occur, even from Gamora.  
  
While you are allowed to chose a face-down character for Net Launcher's super power, this does NOT mean you are stunning them. You can NOT daze/stun a character that is already stunned. Now if they are face-down because they are hidden, then sure you can daze/stun them.

In this Arc, we are playing around with how players can use locations besides super powers. In addition to cards like Nikki (who has a keyword power which requires spending an (Alien/"Space")), each Issue will have a Plot Twist and Special Location that allow their main characters to have some pretty powerful effects on the game. A few things about these Plot Twists and Special Locations: 

* They are not super powers.  
* Your main characters must be face up to pay for them. (But it doesn't have to be in the combat to pay for Nova Corps.)  
* Your main characters can use a "Wild" Special Location from their team to pay for them.  
* These cards are neutral, so just like any other neutral cards they can be in Loyalty decks.  
* The Special Locations don't count as locations power symbol (for powers like Black Widow Main Character's Level Up power **Red in Her Ledger** or Zzutak's **Paint to Life**).

> The Nullifier's effect can be Nullified by effects that turn off keyword powers and if it changes sides it will target the updated "enemy characters" as the affected target(s).

This was clarified in July 2019 that many people were playing this card incorrectly. We originally believed this card to work in a way that made Nullifier's effect independent of the card itself, so it could not be Nullified. Essentially that the effect and targets would be unchanged until the card left the play zone, even if it swapped sides or got targeted by Cosmo or another Nullifier.

^(Source: UDE official clarification)


---

> The Nullifier only affect powers that resolve in the play zone.

This was clarified in July 2019 that the Nullifier will have no effects on powers that resolve before they appear such as Dark Phoenix SC who has a "When you recruit Dark Phoenix" trigger. Recruiting happens before appearing so it cannot be stopped with the Nullifier. This is also true of cards that have effects that will resolve from your hand such as Shadowcat SC's Intagible Escape. You can still name a power that is not in play yet, but Nullifier will only act upon that power once the card is in play and some effects will resolve before that point.

^(Source: UDE official clarification)

---

To explain the above differently:

First, the Nullifier does two things: A triggered power when it appears (you name a thing); then, a continuous power that keeps the named thing turned off.

Because this is now classified as a continuous modifier it means that it will impact characters played after the Nullifier entered play.

It also means that the Nullifier can now be Nullified. Cosmo or an opposing Nullifier can now Nullify the continuous modifier. It also means that when Grid steals a Nullifier it continues to work, targeting *enemy* characters. This turns the Nullifier against the player who played it.

Q: What happens when Onslaught comes back from Singularity's **Pocket Dimension**? Does he keep the ATK/DEF and Health he gained from when he was recruited?

A: If he is removed from the game and comes back, he is a 0/0 with 0 health. The Modifier created by **Joint Consciousness** can not track him between zones, so once he leaves play, it no longer applies. When he comes back into play, **Joint Consciousness** will not trigger.

Q: What happens if I **Nullify** Onslaught with Cosmo?

A: Cosmo prevents powers from working, it does NOT stop modifiers from applying to a character. Once **Joint Consciousness** has resolved and established the base stats, using Cosmo on him will NOT change that. It will only suppress any powers he may have gained.

Q: What happens if Onslaught has a +1/+1 counter and is moved to Singularity's **Pocket Dimension**. He comes back as 1/1 with 0 Health, is he stunned?

# Pixie

## [Pixie](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-008.jpg) (MC)
*Set: The Utopia Battles*  

**Souldagger** causes a character to lose each modifier it gained during combat. A modifier is an effect that modifies the game. There are two types of modifiers – 

A one-shot modifier does something immediately and then is done. Example: “Put two +1/+1 counters on a character.”

 A continuous modifier has an ongoing effect on the game, which may or may not have a duration. Example: “Choose a character to get +2/+0 and **Lethal** this combat.” 
 
When Pixie uses **Souldagger**, it will cause an enemy character to lose any continuous modifiers that are applying to it. (It won’t stop any one-shot modifiers because it’s impossible for there to be any one-shot modifiers happening while you use **Souldagger**.) 

**Half-Fairy** will give Pixie an XP when any character (including an enemy) pays an (Energy/"Blue"). This includes when a character uses an (Engergy/"Blue") Super Power, or choosing to spend an (Energy/"Blue") when you play the Plot Twist **Sacred Ground**.

A: Pixie's effect becomes independent of Pixie once it brings Adam into play. So if Adam is in play at End of Turn, he will be KO'ed.

# [Power Man](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/DFX-017.jpg)
*Set: The New Defenders*  

Some characters are known by more than one moniker - like Power Man, who says **AKA Luke Cage**. He counts as having both names, which means you can use a Luke Cage supporting character to Power Up Power Man, and vice versa. It also means they both count as the same person for the purposes of the Uniqueness rules.

Power Man loves a good party, especially if he wasn’t invited. His **Crash the Party** power counts each enemy power, even if there are multiple instances of the same power. But remember face-down characters lose their powers so he won’t count their powers.

Q: If Prof X MC uses **Mental Domination** to take control of Sister Grimm MC and suicides her, does she level up?

Q: Can I steal a Main Character with **Mental Domination**?

## [Professor X](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/NEW-005.jpg) (MC - New Mutants)
*Set: New Mutants*  

In this set the Professor gets a whole new main character, and this time he goes up to Level 3. (Note: This new Professor X can’t level up into the old one from The Marvel Battles set and vice versa. A main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork as it does.) 

Professor X’s **Graduation** power lets you turn an (X-Men) supporting character into the main character version of that character. (Once it’s become a main character it can level up normally. Professor X is a really good teacher.)

This allows you to have any number of main characters in play at once. However, Professor X is still your MAIN main character – if he gets KO’d you’ll lose the game. (Your other main characters getting KO’d won’t cause you to lose the game.)

The new character uses a physical supporting character card but erases its name, team affiliation, and game text and powers and replaces them with the name Fire Man, the (Brotherhood) team symbol, and the Creature keyword. (Which means it can’t have equipment.) When it’s KO’d or otherwise leaves play the card will go back to counting as the character printed on it.

# [The Reality Gem](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-020.jpg)
*Set: Black Order*  

You can use this Gem to turn cards in play face up. If you choose a stunned character this counts as recovering it. If you choose a hidden character, it counts as un-hiding it. If you choose a face-down location, it will turn face up. If you choose any other type of face-down resource (including an Infinity Gem), it will remain face down. (It should be revealed to each player to prove that it's not a location). 

You can also use the Gem to turn cards in play face down. If you do this to a ready character, it counts as hiding it. If you do it to an exhausted character, it counts as dazing it (i.e. stun it but it doesn't gain a wound). 

If you do it to an equipment, that equipment will stay equipped but its powers are temporarily turned off. It will turn face up again when the characters on that side would recover. If you do it to a location or face-up Infinity Gem, it will turn face down.

Q: Ok, so now I have two Rogues in play (via Madame Masque as mentioned above); if the first one with **Swarm** is Stunned does she lose **Swarm** and do I lose the second copy to uniqueness?

A: While the stunning itself would NOT remove **Swarm**, that is not relevant here. The modifier that gives Rogue **Swarm** has a duration that only lasts UNTIL she is stunned. So when she is stunned, the modifier stops giving her **Swarm**, and you will need to apply the uniqueness rule if relevant.

Before he was the Scarlet Spider, the man who would become Ben Reilly was created from Peter Parker’s DNA to be a perfect clone. So in the game he actually starts off as a different “Spider” hero until his true self is revealed (once he reaches Level 2). Here’s how it works: 

Your Spider Web is a new out-of-play pile that includes up to one copy of every other Level 1 main character with “Spider” in its name. (Currently this includes Spider-Man from The Marvel Battles expansion, \* Spider-Man \* from Monsters Unleashed, and Spider-Man and Spider-Woman from this Issue.) 

Your Clone Pile is another out-of-play pile. It starts empty but during the game you’ll put characters from your Spider Web into it. 

Before the game begins, when each player reveals their main character, you’ll reveal the Scarlet Spider. Then instead of putting him on your side during setup, you’ll put a character from your Spider Web onto your side. 

When that character would become Level 2, you’ll instead transform it into Level 2 Scarlet Spider. (It will keep its counters, any effects on it, and its ready/exhausted and face-up/facedown orientation.) Then put the Level 1 main character he started the game as and the Level 1 Scarlet Spider main character into your Clone Pile. 

Once he’s Level 2, if he would be wounded, there’s a chance it was just a clone body instead: reveal a random card from your Clone Pile. If you reveal Scarlet Spider, he’ll get wounded as normal – they found you! But if you reveal someone else, he doesn’t get wounded (although whoever was revealed goes back into your Spider Web.)

*Set: Spider-Friends*  

Scarlet Spider Scarlet Spider’s **Paralytic Darts** cause an enemy character to become immobilized indefinitely. This effect lasts even after Scarlet Spider leaves play. (It will end once the immobilized character leaves play.)

# [Scarlet Witch](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-013.jpg)
*Set: The Defenders*  

Scarlet Witch’s **Hex** power prevents enemy Main Characters from Leveling Up. They can still gain XP up to their Level Up number, but not beyond. And once Scarlet Witch gets stunned or leaves play, if they have enough XP, they’ll immediately Level Up.

Q: What happens to the MC when Singularity takes them out the game while being **Hex**ed by Scarlet Witch?

A: Scarlet Witch isn't targeting your opponent's MC, it is a blanket effect on the game state. The real question then becomes, can MC's level up outside the game at that point, which is no.

# [Scourge](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HAM-014.jpg)
*Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.*

# [Secret Hideout](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SFO-016.jpg)
*Set: Spidey-Foes*  

**Family is a Source of Weakness** lets your (Sinister Syndicate) Main Character take a **Hostage**. If you have any Secret Hideouts in your deck, you must bring a Hostage pile, which includes one ore more *different* (Spider-Friends) Supporting Characters with the **Friends and Family** keyword.

When you play Secret Hideout, one of your Main Characters takes a **Hostage**. Choose a character from your Hostage pile and put it beneath the Secret Hideout as a **Hostage**. Your Main Character gets the Keyword Power granted by that Hostage *while that Main Character is in your front row*.

For example, if you take Mary Jane hostage, your Main Character will gain **Pounce** while it's in  your front row. (It doesn't have to be protecting anyone.)

When that Main character gets stunned or leaves play, turn the Secret Hideout face down and set the **Hostage** aside. (It doesn't go back to your Hostage pile.) Similarly, if an effect turns the Secret Hideout face down, set the **Hostage** aside. Once the **Hostage** card is no longer beneath the Secret Hideout it also stops granting its Keyword Power.

It's possible for the same Main Character to have multiple Hostages (one for each Secret Hideout you play while you have that Main Character). 

Note: A **Hostage** is never actually in play. It's either in a Hostage pile, beneath a Secret Hideout, or set aside (after leaving a Secret Hideout).

Shadow King is technically a supporting character but he doesn’t want to actually be in play. He prefers to have a physical host. If he would appear for any reason, you’ll remove him from the game instead and choose a face-up character on your side to be his Host. If you don’t have a face-up character, Shadow King will still be removed from the game. When his Host gets stunned or leaves play Shadow King will remain removed from the game.

# [She-Hulk](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/aff-003.jpg) (MC)
*Set: A-Force*  

**Rules Lawyer**  
She-Hulk’s main character introduces a new kind of super power called a **Reaction**. It reads: 

> Reaction : When an enemy player uses a super power, you may say “Objection!” If you do, cancel that super power.

Reaction powers trigger when a certain condition is met (in this case it’s “When an enemy player uses a super power”). When that happens you can pay an (and say “Objection” of course) and if you do it cancels the super power so it never takes effect.

You can use a Reaction power at any time, as long as its trigger condition is met. However, like other super powers, you can only use it once per turn.

^(Source: Rule insert)

Q: How does **Rules Lawyer** work timing wise under the rules for effects needing to resolve as soon as they are played?

A: Basically when She-Hulk LV2 is in play, whenever an opponent uses a Super Power, they will need to give the She-Hulk player a chance to respond before resolving the effect.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

---

Q: How does **Rules Lawyer** work if the Super Power needs one choice made from multiple options?

A: If the effect requires a choice, like choosing a character, the She-Hulk player has to make their decision on whether or not to use **Rules Lawyer** before those choices are made.

Q: How does She-Hulk's **Rules Lawyer** work against Sister Grimm MC? I announce **Open Sesame** and flip my Academy. My opponent says objection and flips his. Do I lose my level and my ability to ever use **Open Sesame** again? And does Sister Grimm flip back to Level 1?

Q: How does **Rules Lawyer** work on powers like **Nullify** or **Magnetic Supression**?

## [Singularity](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/aff-015.jpg) (SC - AFF-015*)
*Set: A-Force*

Q: What happens if I use Singularity's power to remove my characters, then on my opponent's turn, Singularity is targeted by Cosmo. Do my characters still return at the end of the turn or when singularity is stunned/leaves play?

A: Singularity's power creates a delayed triggered modifier that exists independent of its source. Removing the power from the source does nothing to negate or change the delayed trigger modifier already created. In short, playing Cosmo on Singularity does not stop the previously removed characters from returning.

Q: What happens to the character brought in by Pixie if I want to RFG it with Singularity?

Q: If you Singularity Doc Oc does he draw at the start of your turn?

A: The delayed trigger from Singularity and Genius both trigger "At the start of your turn..."

So you do not draw from Genius brought back with Singularity in the same turn.

Q: Juggernaut attacks Singularity who is in the front row, pays a Might and stuns her. Do the other characters come back in time for Juggernaut to declare his second attack or no?

A:  The controller of Singularity decides which row the characters come back into play. So they could put them in the front row, or the back row. So if they opt to put them all in the front row, it is no dice. If they put at least one in the back row, the next question then becomes, can Juggernaut attack them? And the answer is YES! You see, Singularity triggers upon her leaving play which is during combat resolution, so that is when her power triggers. Juggernaut on the other hand, triggers after combat resolution is over. Since Singularity triggered first, it will resolve first and your opponent could opt to put a character into his back row. IF he does, then it will be there for Juggernaut to attack when his trigger resolves.

# Sister Grimm

Q: The Singularity ruling states that when a character comes back into play it is a new character and nothing has now previously effected it. Can Sister Grimm use a **...Let the Staff of One Emerge** ability she has previously used since technically she's a new character and now has not technically used the previous ability?

A: A once per game restriction is something that functions in all zones, no matter who controls the character or what zone it is in. This means even if a character with a power with a once per game restriction leaves play and comes back, you still can not use it again if it was used before leaving play. Also if an opponent takes control of a character with a one per game restriction, if they use the super power, when you get it back, you will not be able to use that power.

*Set: Spider-Friends*  

**I Can and Will Fight You**
This issue introduces the powerful Alien Symbiote version of Spider-Man. But as they say, with great alien power comes great alien… danger. While the symbiote does make him stronger, he must remove it or it will quickly be game over. In the comics, when Spider-Man fights off the symbiote, it splits off from him as a separate entity. In the game, when Spider-Man sheds the symbiote, it splits off from him as a separate card. When this happens, Spider-Man will become Level 2 and now wears a cloth version of his black costume and the Alien Symbiote will look for a new host. (Note: Spider-Man Level 2 has one less Health – this represents losing the strength of the symbiote.) 

When a character with the Alien Symbiote is turned face down but isn’t KO’d, just keep the equipment token face up and ready, just like when it’s equipped to a face-up character (it doesn’t exhaust or turn face down). And remember, the symbiote is a jealous entity – it can’t be destroyed or removed from its host (at least until the host leaves play).

If you remove exactly one **Update** he gains (Flight) and (Range) until he leaves play. If you remove exactly two **Updates**, put two vitality counters on him. If you remove exactly three **Updates**, put twelve +1/+1 counters on him.

You can remove the same number of **Updates** more than once. For example, if you remove the two **Updates** for a second time, Spider-Man will get two more vitality counters.

*Set: The MCU Battles*  

**Dance Off, Bro**  
Star-Lord (Main Character) Star-Lord’s Level Up power lets you start a Dance Off. Starting with you, each player may exhaust one of their ready characters or they’re out of the Dance Off. Repeat this process until only one player is left. They’re the winner.

## [Star Lord](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu1-019.jpg) (SC - Photo)
*Set: The MCU Battles*  

Star-Lord’s **Half Celestial** power prevents him from being KO’d as long as you have a face-up main character on your side. However, if Star-Lord has fatal wounds and your main character gets turned face down, Star-Lord will immediately become KO’d.

# \* [Star Lord](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-006.jpg) \*
*Set: Galactic Guardians*  

Kitty Pryde becomes Star-Lord when the original Star-Lord is otherwise employed. So she has *s around her name, meaning she shares the "mantle" with Star-Lord, himself. The sharing of the mantle means both characters can be on a side at the same time because they're different beings, just with the same name. So you don't KO either because of the uniqueness rules and they can't power each other up.

Note that although this card represents her joining the Guardians of the Galaxy she's still an X-Men at heart, so she has both team affiliations.

Her **Intangibility** power lets her strike characters while they're in a player's hand. This is uncanny. A couple things about this: 

* She can strike any number of 0 DEF characters (or characters with * DEF).  
* She can strike characters who normally couldn't be struck by her while on a side (like Bulletproof characters) because those powers aren't active while the character is in a hand.  
* It doesn't matter how much (Health) a struck character has, it gets discarded.

# Strength Above All Else
*Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra*

Q: 

* My 1/10 Mystique MC is attacking Baron Von Strucker who is a 6/2. I play Masquerade, and match his power.  
* 6/10 Mystique attacking 6/3 Baron. I've played her super power and pass.  
* Baron plays Strength Above All Else. At this moment we match so he has highest attack and can't be struck this combat.  
* Priority back to me, I play Cat Fight to raise my attack to 10/10.  
  
Does Strength Above All Else still prevent the damage? Did it just grant protection when it resolves, or does it check for ATK again at strike?

A: if you are the highest ATK character during combat resoluition you can't be struck

>Supreme Leader's effect will prevent you from losing the game and will also prevent other players from winning the game

Supreme Leader MC is worded in a way that may make veterans of other card games such as Magic the Gathering believe that a card like [Dutch SC](https://i.imgur.com/N3EzGfJ.jpg) or [Deadpool MC](https://i.imgur.com/3Qt4DfF.png) may still allow an alternate win condition.  After all, in MtG a player being unable to lose doesn't prevent another player from winning as they are isolated effects.  In VS 2PCG this is considered an extension of the "can't beats can" rule.  By that logic, alternate win conditions are ignored as long as Supreme Leader is preventing its controller from losing the game.

# [Taskmaster](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/LEG-051.jpg)
*Set: Legacy*

Q: What happens if I recruit Taskmaster while my opponent has Onslaught in play?

A: So Onslaught's Power happens at the time you recruit him (faster than appears powers).  
  
Taskmaster comes into play, but doesn't have Onslaught's power when he's recruited, so nothing happens.  
  
As far as the power's that Onslaught has, Taskmaster doesn't copy those because they aren't Printed Powers like Taskmaster is looking for.  
  
So Onslaught is effectively doing nothing for Taskmaster.

> Keyword abilities are only in effect while the character card is in play unless otherwise specified.

Previous to [Taskmaster's](https://i.imgur.com/85KjJHT.jpg) release, keyword abilities were active in all zones.  This allowed cards such as [Hope Summers](https://i.imgur.com/R2iOAee.png) to use their powers from the hand, deck or KO pile.  With the release of Taskmaster, this rule became limiting on design of future cards and was changed.  (For example, Taskmaster was able to be recruited from the deck with [Spider-Gwen's](https://i.imgur.com/ZkdbqZ0.png) Dimensional Watch keyword if your opponent had her in play.)

>A copied power can't copy a power with the same name as itself.

An infinite loop was discovered when [Taskmaster](https://i.imgur.com/85KjJHT.jpg) was across from an opposing Taskmaster where they would gain a copy of, then continuously copy the printed version of their opponent's Photgraphic Reflexes.  With this additional rule, this scenario would result in Taskmaster gaining two instances of all keyword powers for face-up enemy supporting characters, but the loop would not continue beyond two instances.

Q: When a token takes lethal damage, does it become KO'd and count towards Thanos' level up ability?

A: Thanos will gain XP from a Token being KO'd and Tokens will exist for a brief moment in the KO pile before ceasing to exist via the rules of the game. Basically if a token ever ends up in a non play zone, it will cease to exist.

Q: If I use Professor X to take my opponent's level 2 Thanos, and I use **Infinity Gauntlet**, does Thanos get stunned?

A: No, "Your" refers to the MC you control. At the time **Infinity Gauntlet** resolves, the opponent does not control an MC, so nothing happens with that part of the effect.

^(Source: Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

# [Thanos](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-005.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Black Order*  

At Level 1, if Thanos gets KO'd by getting stunned, **Resurrected by Death Herself** will cause him to gain an XP and become Level 2 while in the stunned position. (If a power like Hex prevents him from leveling up, he'll remain at Level 1 but still heal his wounds.)

**Schemes and Dreams**  prevents you from drawing cards during your Draw Phase, including your normal draws plus effects like Genius. However, if Thanos is face down at the start of your turn, Schemes and Dreams will be turned off. This means you can draw cards during your Draw Phase, however you can't search for a card.

**My Quest Begins** counts each card that enters your hand from your deck. So if you draw three cards, that would be 3 XP.
  
**The Universe Will Now Be Set Right**  has a 50-50 chance of removing each character on each side from the game. If this removes a players last main character, that player ;oses the game. If this removes each player's last main character (including Thanos, himself) then the Thanos player wins the game. (This is similar to how if the final two main characters KO each other in combat, the player whose turn it was wins.)

Thor’s **Journey of Self Discovery** Level Up power requires him to make three separate attacks in the order printed on his card to gain an XP. These attacks don’t have to be in a row. For example, he could make a solo attack, then a team attack with one teammate, then another solo attack, and finally when he team attacks with exactly two other characters he’ll gain an XP.

# \* [Thor](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/COS-011.jpg) \*
*Set: Cosmic Avengers*  

Jane Foster becomes Thor when the original Thor shirks his responsibility. She has \*s around her name, meaning she shares the "mantle" with Thor himself. This means both characters can be on a side at the same time because they're different beings, just with the same name. So you don't KO either because of uniqueness rules and they can't power each other up. When Thor is ready to start being "the" Thor again, Jane gracefully demurs. 

To represent this, her **There Must Always Be a Thor** power can only search for a card named "Thor" (with no \*s ) or with **AKA Thor** (like Odinson). It can't get a copy of herself. 

Jane's **A God Who Knows How Precious Life Is** is not a super power.

Ultron is really six main characters in one: three identical Level 1s, two identical Level 2s, and one Level 3. Before the game starts you’ll put one Level 1 Ultron onto your side. The remaining five Ultron cards will start out of play in a face-up pile called your **Ultron Facility**. 

During the game you can use any Ultron’s **There’s Only One Path To Peace** power to put the lowest level Ultron from your Ultron Facility onto your side. When one of your Ultron main 27 characters gets KO’d it goes back to your Ultron Facility where it will be available to be brought back again.

# [Wyatt Wingfoot](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-014.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

**Self-Awareness**  
Wyatt knows he is in a  **Card Game**, and he wants to play too! So when he appears, and until he leaves play, he gets his own hand and resource row.  **Note:** His hand counts as being part of your hand, and his resource row counts as being part of your resource row.

Here’s how it works:

*   At the end of your Draw Phase, Wyatt draws two cards into his part of your hand. (Keep these cards separate from the main part of your hand.)  
    *   **This is the only way to add cards to his part of your hand**. If another effect would add cards to your hand, they always go to the main part of your hand, never to Wyatt’s part of your hand.  
    *  All other effects that affect your hand work as normal.  
        *   For example, if you are forced to ”discard a random card”, you must randomize all the cards in your hand, including Wyatt’s part of your hand.  
* At the end of your Resource Step, Wyatt may play a resource from his hand into his part of your resource row. (Keep these resources separate from the main part of your resource row.)
    *   **This is the only way to add resources to his part of your resource row**. If another effect would add resources to your resource row, they always go to the main part of your resource row, never to Wyatt’s part of your resource row.  
* At the end of your Recruit Step (after you’ve spent your normal Recruit Points to play cards from the main part of your hand, and any leftover Recruit Points go away), you gain 1 Recruit Point for each resource in Wyatt’s part of the resource row. You can only spend these Recruit Points to play cards from Wyatt’s part of your hand.  
* Characters and Equipment you play from Wyatt’s part of the hand work as normal once they are on your side. (Once they’re in play, it doesn’t matter if they came from your main hand or Wyatt’s part of your hand.)  
* You can play Plot Twists or power-ups from Wyatt’s part of your hand as normal.  
* You can spend Locations in Wyatt’s part of your resource row or discard them from Wyatt’s hand to generate power symbols normally.  
* When Wyatt leaves play, remove the cards in his part of your hand and resource row from the game. (Characters and Equipment played from his part of your hand stay in play.)

**Note:** If Wyatt gets moved to another player’s side, remove all the cards in his part of your hand and resource row from the game. Now Wyatt will draw extra cards and play extra resources for that player.

It still keeps its other information like name and team affiliation. If a hidden character gets stunned somehow, change it to the stunned orientation (face down and exhausted). A hidden character will turn face up the same time your stunned characters would recover.
