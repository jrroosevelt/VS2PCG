Here is the list of the most common recurring keywords, powers or terms that are listed but not always defined on the card.  This list is also being updated to include general FAQs about some of these keywords.
  
 # +1/+1 and -1/-1 (Counters)
Many effects put +1/+1 or -1/-1 counters on characters. These numbers alter a character's ATK and DEF until something removes the counters.
 
If a character ever has +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters at the same time they cancel out. Remove one of each until the character only has one type.

If an effect gives a character "+1/+1" or "-1/-1" but doesn't say "counter" then that effect is temporary: you don't add counters to the character.

These types of counters are removed if a character is turned face-down (typically as a result of the character being stunned or hiding).

#  Absorption History
  See the [card-specific clarification for Mimic (MC)](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_mimic_.28mc.29).
  

# Agenda  

* When you build a deck with a starting Main Character with the printed Syndicate team affiliation, you must choose ONE Syndicate Agenda. It will start the game out of play face down in your Agenda pile.  
  
* Your Agenda does not count toward your 60-card deck.  
  
* Your Agenda pile is private. (Your opponents can’t look at it, but you can look at it at any time.)  
  
* While it’s in your Agenda pile, you can play it just like a normal Plot Twist, and after it resolves put it into your KO pile. (Once it goes to your KO pile, it works just like any other Plot Twist. For example, if you somehow get it back into your hand, you can play it again.)  
  

# Agent  
When this character appears, look at cards from the top of your deck equal to the number of Agents on your side.  Put any of them on the bottom of your deck. 

---

Q: Can I put cards back on the top or bottom in any order?

A: Yes, you can pick the order.

# Air Superiority
  Characters with Flight can't strike this character.

# AKA [name]  
Some characters, like \*Daredevil\*, have **AKA** and another name in their text box (in this case it's **AKA Iron Fist**). This represents the fact that some beings in the Marvel Universe have more than one name. In this case, Danny Rand is the current Daredevil during Civil War, but he's better known as Iron Fist!

In game terms, this means that characters with **AKA** have both names for both Uniqueness and Powering up characters. So you can't have Iron Fist and \*Daredevil\* on your side at the same time because they're both Danny Rand!

**AKA** is not a power and so it can't be copied or turned off by anything that affects powers.

# Amortal   
This power currently only exists on the [*Death* Main Character](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_death).

# Amplify  
If you discard the location from your hand to power this super power you gain the text after the word Amplify.  
  

# Angry  
This character must be in your first attack each turn if able.  (It can be a team attack.)  

---

Q: Does the Angry character *have* to attack?

A: You may choose not to attack at all. However, if you do decide to attack, the **Angry** character must be a participant in your first one.

# Any Turn Symbol
If a Plot Twist or Super Power has this symbol, you can play it, or a character can use it on another player's turn (as well as your turn).
 
# Appears
When a card enters play it “appears.” Whether you played it from hand or some modifier put it into play. If a card changes sides or is turned face-up, that does not count as “appearing.” When a character, location, or equipment appears, it is a new character, location, or equipment. 

# ATK/DEF
The numbers on characters above the lightning and shield symbols. During combat you compare your character's ATK (attack) to its enemy's DEF (defense) to see if you stun it.

# Ban  
Name a character and choose a number.  Put all supporting characters with that name on enemy sides into their owner's hands.  For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players' sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles have a cost equal to the chosen number and nothing can ever, ever change that.  

# Base ATK and DEF
Some effects refer to a character's Base ATK and DEF. This means a character's stats before any effects or counters modify them. A character's Base ATK and DEF are usually the same as their printed ATK and DEF. The only difference is that some effects might temporarily change a character's Base stats.
  

# Battle of Wills

This term currently only exists on Iso-Sphere, an equipment card in Crossover Vol 3

A Battle of Wills requires characters to bid how many power symbols they’ll pay to take (or keep) control of the Iso-Sphere. It works like this: The equipped character starts the bidding. (They can bid 0.) Then the next player either chooses a face-up character on their side to bid a higher number or passes. If they pass, they’re out of the Battle of Wills. Then the next player goes, and so on until all but one player passes. Then that player’s character pays the winning number of power symbols from their resource row (no discarding from hand) and the Iso-Sphere is moved to that character (if it’s not already there). Note: A character can’t bid a number they can’t pay. Once you choose a character as a bidder, you can’t choose a different character to be your bidder in the same Battle of Wills.

# Berserker  
When this character attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on it  
  

# Biosentinel  
 The Biosentinel keyword does nothing by itself and is instead referenced by other powers.  
  

# Bulletproof  
  Characters with Range can't strike this character. *(Even in melee combat.)*  
  

# Burn  
   Stun this character at the end of each of your turns.  
  
# Camouflage
When in the back row, this character cannot be attacked.

# Cancel
If an effect cancels the current combat, the combat ends but no characters get stunned. Leave all the attackers and defenders as is. They don't ready. if an effect cancels a Plot Twist, discard the Plot Twist without resolving its effects. If an effect cancels a Super Power, don't resolve its effects. Locations turned face down or discarded to pay for the Super Power are **not** turned face up or returned to hand.

# Capture  
Remove the captured character from the game but keep track of any wound counters on it.  When the captor leaves play, put its captive back into play stunned in its owner's back row.  
  

#  Card Game
 This is a power currently available on [Wyatt Wingfoot](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_wyatt_wingfoot).
 
To summarize, Wyatt will draw cards into his own "hand" and place resources into his own "resource row" that can be used to recruit during his own recruit step to bring cards onto your side.  When Wyatt leaves play or changes sides, his hand and resource row are removed from the game.  
  
# Card Name
Name means not only the name printed on the name line, but also any **AKAs** the character has in their text box. ‘Card title’ is defined as only the name on the name line (see below).  

^Source: [^Upper ^Deck ^Blog](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2020/05/vs-system-2pcg-the-herald-card-preview-1/)

# Card Title  
 The name of a card on the name line (ignoring AKAs).  
  
# Choose  
Many cards tell you to "Choose a [thing]". For example, choose a Super Power, or choose a Supporting Character. Unlike when you **name** something, you can only **choose** an item that is in play (aka in the Play Zone) unless otherwise indicated.

For example, Captain Swain says, "When Swain appears, choose a super power on a supporting character." In this case, because no specific Zone is indicated, you can choose a super power only on a supporting character currently in play.

^Source [^Reddit ^Post](https://discord.com/channels/306874195051020288/768614566594478080/788521217635909633)

# Climb  
At the start of your Main Phase, you may exhaust a location on your side. If you do, put a +1/+1 counter on this character.  
  
Exhausted Locations can still be flipped face-down to pay for super powers but a face-down Location cannot be climbed (it is not counted as a location while face-down).  Exhausted Locations also do not generate Recruit Points but with Climb they will recover before the start of the Build Phase anyway so that is a non-issue.  


# Clone

* Put a token copy of the chosen character onto your side. The copy has all the printed characteristics (name, team, cost, ATK/DEF, Health, powers) of that character but nothing else. It appears face up and ready, and does not appear with any counters or status effects (like Burn). Uniqueness does apply to the token.

# Collect  
A term used on the Collector supporting character from the Legacy set.

Remove the chosen character from the game. You may only collect a character with a different team affiliation from every other character you've collected this game.  A collection is unique to a player.  
  
# Collection
A term used on the Collector main character Level 2 from Crossover Vol 3

The Collector’s Collection can only have one equipment, one plot twist, and one supporting character at a time. But once one is played from his Collection, he is free to add another card of that type to his Collection.

# Combat Master  
While this character is in combat, enemy players can't play plot twists.  
  

# Comet Fall  
 When this character appears, put a -1/-1 counter on each enemy character.  

# Counters
There are various effects that result in adding a counter to your character. A counter is a marker that represents some sort of modification to your card. The most common type of counters are +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters, but there are a few other types. For more information, see the specific types below:
* [+1/+1 and -1/-1 Counters](https://www.reddit.com/r/vs2pcg/wiki/glossary#wiki_.2B1.2F.2B1_and_-1.2F-1_.28counters.29)
* [Vitality Counters](https://www.reddit.com/r/vs2pcg/wiki/glossary#wiki_vitality_counter)
* [Wound Counters](https://www.reddit.com/r/vs2pcg/wiki/glossary#wiki_wounds_.28and_wound_counters.29)
* [XP Counters](https://www.reddit.com/r/vs2pcg/wiki/glossary#wiki_xp_.28and_xp_counters.29)

Q: Assume I have Match (4/1 ATK/DEF). I attack Charlie-27 (1/1). When Match strikes, does Charlie get 4 -1/-1 counters or just 1? In other words, are all the negative counters applies, or only enough to stun the character?

A: Counters are gained all at once.

Charlie will receive four -1/-1 counters. Then he will get stunned (assuming Charlie is 1/1).

^(Source: Email from UDE)

---

Q: According to Magma, if a character has a counter, they still get an opposing counter before those 2 counters cancel each other out. For the sake of XP conditions like Johnny Storm and Pro-Registration Black Widow, how do they gain XP if opposing counters are in the way?

A: 


# Creature  
This character cannot be equipped.  
  

# Daze  
An effect that stuns a character without the character gaining a wound. It works like the character getting stunned in **all** ways except for adding a wound counter.
  

#  Deconstruct the Universe
[See the specific-card clarification page](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_dark_phoenix_.28sc.29) for details on this keyword that only exists on Dark Phoenix Supporting Character that reads: *"When you recruit Dark Phoenix, you may remove one of the following concepts from the game:"*  
  
# Dimensional Wristwatch  
You may recruit this character from your deck. (Search your deck for them, shuffle, then recruit them.)  
  
In tournament play, you're only allowed to search for and fail to find a character with this keyword once.  After that you're just shuffling your deck for free and it is frowned upon.  
  
# Discard
Taking a card from your hand and putting it into your KO pile.

# Dodge  
This character cannot be Range attacked  
  

# Duplicate  
A Duplicate has all the same printed characteristics as your Main Character – name, team, current Level, and powers with an ATK/DEF of 0/1 and 1 Health – plus it has Swarm and it can’t gain XP, can’t Level up or Level Down, transform, or otherwise become a different card. When it’s KO’d it will go back to being the Parallel Dimension Plot Twist in your KO pile.  
  

# Durable  
If this character would get stunned other than by getting struck in combat, it doesn't get wounded. When this character gets stunned other than by getting struck in combat, you may recover it.  

# Enemy
This applies to anything opposing you. An enemy player is your opponent. An enemy character is one on your opponent's side.

# Enters combat
A character enters combat when they become an attacker or defender. This is typically when the attack is initially declared. However, certain card effects can change when this occurs. For example, when Uncanny Defense is played, the new defender "enters combat" at that point. Other cards that change when a character enters combat include, but are not limited to: Dramatic Entrance, Gadget, and Superior Spider Man (MC). 

# Equipment
Equipment is a type of card that is attached to character and gives it powers. During your turn you can put Equipment cards onto your characters by paying the cost just like a character. Just like an affiliated plot-twist, you can only play an equipment if you have a face-up character with the matching team/brand affiliation; however that equipment can go on any character you control. See [Playing Equipment in the Official Rules](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1nF6Wh6sNSTgopLu9-3p4P58LSq-pC-bxInOnBTvhRwc/mobilebasic#h.aexu5x31ppi) for more information.

--- 

Q: When a character is a different team affiliation than an equipment that is attached to them. Can you use the character’s ‘wild’ location to pay the Equipment's power? Or does it have to be the Equipment-affiliated ‘wild’ location?

For example, if Misty Knight (Defenders) is using a Net Launcher can she use the Sanctum Sanctorum (Defenders wild location) to pay for it?

A: It would be the wild location for the character, not the equipment. So Misty could use Sanctum Sanctorum to pay the cost for its power.

# Eternal  
If this character would leave play, you may put them into their owner's hand instead.  
  

# Errata  
Name a character.  For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players' sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles lose and can't gain powers. *(Including Flight and Range)*  

This ability is currently available on the [Deadpool MC from the Deadpool & Friends set](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_deadpool_.28mc_-_underworld.29).

# Evil 
Classification of a card's affiliation on the scale of [Good or Evil](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/good_or_evil). Used for some game formats or card abilities/effects.

# Fearless  
 While attacking a main character, this character strikes with double its ATK.  
 
 ---

Q: If I get Fearless multiple times, does it stack? For example, if my character has 4 ATK and I have Fearless twice, do I have 8 or 16 ATK?

A: Fearless (and [Violent](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_violent)) do *not* stack. This effect doesn't alter the ATK value itself. It doubles the value with which the character strikes. So, in the above example, the first instance of Fearless sets the strike value (not the ATK value) to 4 x 2 = 8. The second instance of Fearless does the same thing (4 x 2 = 8). 

If the power instead said, "While attacking a main character, double this character's ATK." that would result in the power stacking. (But, of course, that's not what it says.)

# Ferocious  
While in melee combat, this character strikes before characters without Ferocious.  
  

# Flight  
This character can attack protected characters in the back row unless there is a face-up character with Flight in the enemy front row.  
  

# Freeze  
Exhaust a character.  That character can't Ready during its next turn.  

---
Q: If a player is frozen...can they still climb?

A: Frozen only stops readying, so yes

# Friendly  
This character cannot attack. (Note: Unlike **Passive**, this character can strike back.)  
  

# Genius  
 At the start of your turn, draw a card.  
  
Like all powers, Genius is only active while face-up.  Some cards with Genius call this out specifically in their text while others don't but it is true in either case.  

# Golden Rules
Whenever a card contradicts a rule in this Rulebook, the card is correct. And if one effect says you can do something, and another says you can't do something, "can't" beats "can".

# Good
Classification of a card's affiliation on the scale of [Good or Evil](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/good_or_evil). Used for some game formats or card abilities/effects.
  
# Grab  
 While this character is in the front row, enemy characters can't fly over him.  
  

# Graduate  
 Functionally the same as [Transform](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_transform)  
  
# Health (Maximum and Remaining)
A character's maximum health is its printed health and any modifiers that increase or decrease it, like vitality counters. A character's remaining health is its maximum health minus any wounds on it.

# Hex  
 Enemy main characters can't level up. *(They still gain XP.)*  
  

# Hide  
Turn this character face-down but Ready.  He doesn't count as being stunned.  
  
Hidden characters still lose powers, Equipment and +1/+1 or -1/-1 counters.  
  
Hidden characters will turn face up in the Recovery phase.  
  
Hidden characters can't be attacked or defend without special effects allowing attacks on a face-down character.  If attacked or struck, a hidden character can still be stunned and wounded normally. 

A hidden character does not protect anyone behind it, and it loses its powers. It keeps its other information like name and team affiliation. Hidden characters do not satisfy team affiliation requirements for Plot Twists while face-down.

---

Q: Can Hidden characters be targeted by Super Powers? 

A: Unless the ability specifies "Face-Up character," yes, Super Powers can target a Hidden character.

Q: What about a power like \* Nova's \*  **Stellar Flare** or Green Goblin's **Pumpkin Bomb**? Can I stun and wound a Hidden character with a power like that?

A: The short answer is "yes." To explain further...

Typically you cannot *attack* a face-down character (with some exceptions like Devil Slayer and Mr. Black). However, because you can target a Hidden character with Super Powers (unless the power specifies Face-Up characters), you can strike them. Compare the ATK of the character striking to the DEF of the hidden character. If it equals or exceeds, the character moves from Hidden to Stunned and gains a wound.

**Note:** If the character is Stunned, you could still technically target them with a super power. However, you cannot stun a stunned character, so the strike would really do nothing to the target character in that instance.

This is one reason why card orientation is key in distinguishing Hidden (normal) from Stunned (exhausted) characters.

#  [Hologram](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2020/02/vs-system-2pcg-friendly-neighborhood-card-preview-you-dont-want-any-part-of-this-or-do-you/)  
Each Hologram has an associated power symbol. If an enemy character with that type of Super Power appears, it automatically stuns the Hologram.  
  

#  Hostage
For a full breakdown, see the [Sinister Syndicate Special Location Secret Hideout](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_secret_hideout) section of the card-clarification page. 
  

# Hunter  
This character gets +3 ATK while attacking.  
  

# Immobile  
 This character can't move during the formation step.  
  
# Indestructible
 This character can't be wounded.

# Infected
If a character is **Infected**, it gains a -1/-1 counter at the end of each of its owner's turns.

# Infinity  
If a card with Infinity would get put into a KO pile from anywhere, you may shuffle it into its owner's deck instead. [July 2019 Rules Update](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y95RZDM2Ualcn__Z87UTj9kvFgiXk73N/view?fbclid=IwAR2fMgAc9SM3uLepVY2dO1MWQzSHJoBztx7gD9VR3IhbogRIIPBe8upAotw)  
  

# Inspire  
When another character appears on your side, put a +1/+1 counter on it.  
  

# Invade  
While this character is attacking a back row character, it can't strike back at him.  
  

#  [Invention](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2020/04/vs-system-2pcg-the-fantastic-battles-card-preview-fantastic-stories/)  
If you have any characters that can create an Invention (inventors) in your deck, you get a single Invention pile (even if you have multiple different inventors in your deck).  
  
* Invention piles are secret (only you know their contents).  
  
* The Invention pile contains copies of each Invention card without a team affiliation and copies of each Invention card that shares a team affiliation with an inventor in your deck.  
  
* The quantity of each card is equal to its Invention number (the number in parentheses after Invention).  
  
* When a character on your side creates an Invention, secretly choose an Invention card from your Invention pile that either has no team affiliation or that shares a team affiliation with the inventor and put it into your hand.  
  

# Invisibility  
At the end of your turn, if this character is ready, you may [hide](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_hide) her.  
  
# Keyword Power
Keywords are powers that often show up on more than one character. These powers are typically in bold text. When a character has a keyword power, just follow the instructions in its text. (Some common or older keywords might not have their text displayed. In that case, you can look up their definition in this Rulebook.)

Flight and Ranged are the two most common keyword powers.

---

Q: Is there a distinction between Keyword Text and Keyword Powers? I ask because [Dark Phoenix's](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_dark_phoenix_.28sc.29) **Deconstruct the Universe** can disable Keyword Text, but she doesn't disable **Flight** or **Range** when doing so. 

A: In this case, **Flight** and **Range** are just two specific exceptions of Keywords that are not affected by **Deconstruct the Universe**. So, there is not a meaningful distinction between "Keyword Powers" and "Keyword Text".

^(Source: Chad Daniel)

# Invisible  
This character doesn’t protect characters and can attack protected characters.  
  

# Leader  
 While this character is team attacking, you choose who the defender strikes back against.  
  

# Leap  
This character has Flight on your turn.  
  

# Legion  
You may include up to eight copies of this card in your deck.  
  

# Lethal  
If this character wounds a defending supporting character, KO it. *(Lethal's text received errata to trigger on wound and not stun as is written on some older cards.)* 

# Locations
You may use a Location (by turning it face down in your resource row or discarding it from your hand) to pay for a Super Power. But you may not use the same Location card to pay for multiple Super Powers. Each Super Power must be paid for separately.

Once a Location turns face down, it will stay face down unless an effect turns it face up.

There are two types of Locations: Basic Locations and Special Locations. There are six Basic Location types, one for each of the six power symbols. Also, most teams have a Special Location that has a team affiliation symbol on the top right of the card. These Locations can produce your choice of several different power symbols, but only for a member of that team. There are also other Special Locations with other effects beside producing power symbols for Super Powers.

In different issues (like comic or space adventure), Basic Locations may have different names. However, they still count as being the same Basic Location type (for example, one that makes ![](%%Might%%) (Might) ). Your deck can include up to four copies of each of these Basic Location types, and all copies of it must have the same name.
  

# Loyalty  
Put this in your deck only if each card with a team affiliation and each character in your deck share a team affiliation. [July 2019 Rules Update](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y95RZDM2Ualcn__Z87UTj9kvFgiXk73N/view?fbclid=IwAR2fMgAc9SM3uLepVY2dO1MWQzSHJoBztx7gD9VR3IhbogRIIPBe8upAotw)  

---

As of the [June 2020 Rules update](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2020/06/vs-system-2pcg-rules-changes-and-clarifications-june-2020/), the following applies:
Currently, if you want to build a Loyalty deck, all your out-of-game piles must also follow any Loyalty restrictions.

From now on, that rule will be removed:

**Out-of-game piles do NOT need to follow Loyalty restrictions.**

Some examples of what this change will allow:

-   You can now play a Mister Fantastic or Doctor Doom Loyalty deck with an Invention pile.
-   You can now play Dr. Curt Connors (with his Lizard pile) in a Spider-Friends Loyalty deck.
-   You can now use a Secret Hideout (with its Hostage pile) in a Sinister Syndicate Loyalty deck.

^(Source: [Official UDE Blog Post](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2020/06/vs-system-2pcg-rules-changes-and-clarifications-june-2020/))

# Loyalty plot twists
Some plot twists have a stipulation that they can only be put into a "Loyalty"-type deck. These typically mean that your deck must meet the requirements mentioned in the "Loyalty" entry. However, in some cases, there are specific requirements that your deck must be good or evil loyal. In those cases, you don't need all the same team, but need to have all good or all evil characters in your deck, respectively.

Yet other loyalty plot twists have three copies of the affiliated team's logo in the upper right corner. Per the rules, in order to play these plot twists, you must also, "... have three face-up characters with that team symbol in order to play the card." These plot twists are also subject to the requirements mentioned in the Loyalty section as well.
  

# Lumbering  
As this character attacks, the defending player chooses who the defender is. (It must be a character that it could attack.)  
  

# Machine  
Some equipment cards are labeled "Equipment - Machine" beneath their card names.  
  
* If a Machine has a team affiliation, you still need to have a face-up character with that team affiliation symbol on your side (including your Main Character) to play it.  
  
* Machines are not equipped to characters.  Instead put the Machine into one of your rows (the same way you would put a character into a row.)  
  
* Machines can't be rearranged during your Formation Step.  
  
* If there are no face-up characters in a Machine's row, the Machine can be attacked.  A Machine can only be attacked by an enemy character that could normally attack a character in that row.  For example, if a Machine is in your back row, and you have a face-up character in your front row, the Machine can only be attacked be an enemy character that is using an effect like Flight, Stealth or Sniper to avoid your front row character.  
  
* Machines don't protect characters (or other Machines) and never count as being protected.  
  
* When a Machine gets attacked, KO it. (This happens right away.  For example, players won't be able to play Plot Twists and the attacker doesn't "strike" the machine.)  
  
* If a Machine stops being an Equipment for any reason, it also is no longer a Machine.  

# Main Character Required
When a card says that it requires a Main Character with a particular team affiliation, you can't put that card in your deck unless your starting Main Character has that team affiliation.
  

# Martial Artist
 This character has +2/+2 in melee combat.


# Mantle  
A card "shares a mantle" with another card when there are two or more cards in the game with that name, but one of them has one or more stars in the name line.  
  
Cards sharing a mantle are considered to have different names, and if an effect refers to one of them, it will not apply to the other.  
  
For Example: [Captain America](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-015.jpg) and [\*Captain America\*](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SVH-043.jpg) share a mantle.  Both can be on the field at the same time but cannot power each other up because their names are different.  Also because their names are considered to be different, [Jack Flag](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-009.jpg) cannot team attack with \*Captain America\* because his text only refers to Captain America (without the stars).  

# Melee Combat
A combat that involves front row attackers.

# Mercenary
This character can team attack with any Main Character.

---

Q: If I have both Hit Monkey and Masacre, can they both team attack with my Main Character at the same time?

A: In this case, yes. Because Hit Monkey and Masacre are both on the same team already, they can both use their **Mercenary** ability to team attack with your Main Character. However, if you have two supporting characters with **Mercenary** who aren't on the same team (such as Silver Sable and Hit Monkey), they cannot *simultaneously* team attack with your main character.

# Mobile  
Once per turn during your Main Phase but not during combat, you may move this character to your front row or back row.  
  

# Monstrous  
 While this character is defending against a melee team attack, he strikes back against each attacker.  

# Multiple Main Characters
Some card effects allow you to have more than one Main Character in play. In that case, your opponent must KO each Main Character to defeat you, unless the effect states otherwise.

# Name (verb)
Many cards tell you to "Name a [thing]". For example, name a Super Power, or name a Supporting Character. Unlike **choose**, **name** allows you to announce/designate something whether it is or isn't currently in play (unless otherwise indicated).

For example, The Nullifier says, "When The Nullifier appears, name a keyword or super power." In this case, you can name a keyword or super power even if there is no card currently in play with that power.

# Nerf  
Name a character.  For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players' sides and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles are 0/1 with 1 Health and nothing can ever, ever change that.  

This ability is currently available on the [Deadpool MC from the Deadpool & Friends set](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_deadpool_.28mc_-_underworld.29).  

# Nest  
  

* This keyword only exists on the Main Character L2 Hawkeye from MCU Heroes and has the following rules:  
  
* When you spend a power symbol from a Location in your resource row to put Hawkeye into a Nest, you put the Location card partly underneath him and leave it  face up as the Nest. (Note that if you pay for the power by discarding a Location or you reduce the cost of the power to zero power symbols, nothing happens.)  
  
* While a Location is a Nest, it still counts as a Location and as being a face-up resource in your resource row, however it can’t be used to generate a power symbol any more. (So it does generate a resource point.)  
  
* If the Location gets KO’d or leaves your side, the Nest effect ends.  
  
* If the Location gets turned face down by an effect, put it back into your resource row and the Nest effect ends.  
  
* When Hawkeye gets stunned or leaves your side, turn the Location face down and put it into your resource row.  
  
* If Hawkeye uses I Want You On That Roof while he already has a Nest, turn the old Nest face down and put it into your resource row.  
  

# Noble  
While defending, this character strikes with double its ATK.  
  

# One of a Kind  
You may only include one copy of this card in your deck.  

# On Your Side
The cards you have in play are "on your side." You control these cards. If a card gets moved to your side, you now control that card.

# Owner
During the game you "own" your Main Character and all the cards that started in your deck. (This only matters if a card references "owner.")
  

# Passive  
This character cannot attack and cannot strike back.   

# Playing (a card)
The following events are considered playing a card: Playing a Plot Twist, placing a resource or location, recruiting a character or equipment, any card effect that allows you to "play" or "recruit" cards from other zones. 

NOT considered playing a card: Discarding a location to power a super power, discarding a character to power-up, card effects that "put into play" or otherwise don't state "play" or "recruit."

#  Pocket Universe
Summary: Move each other character (everyone but Franklin) to a Pocket Universe. This creates a new front and back row for each player that cannot interact with cards in another "universe."  After each of your turns, take a turn controlling cards in each Pocket Universe you have created.  The Pocket Universe turns skip the Draw and Build phases.  
  
See the [Franklin Richards section of the card-specific clarifications page](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_franklin_richards).
  

# Pounce  
While this character is attacking an exhausted character, it can't strike back at her.

# Power Up
If you have a card in your hand with the same name as a Main or Supporpting Character on your side, you may discard it to Power Up that character. Put a +1/+1 counter on the Powered-Up character. You can Power Up a character either as a **Main** action or as an **Anytime Combat** action.  
  

#  Prediction
Prediction is a power currently on only Mad Thinker. See the [Mad Thinker section](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_mad_thinker) of the card-specific clarifications page for details.

# Protect
A face-up character in a player's front row "protects" face-up characters behind it.

A face-up character in a player's back row is "protected" if there is at least one face-up character in that player's front row.

A protected character can't normally be attacked.
  
# Quick Draw
While this character is ranged attacking, it cannot be struck back.

# Range  
This character can make Ranged attacks from the back row and can strike back when defending from a Ranged attack.  
  
# Ranged Combat
A combat that involves back row attackers that have ![](%%Range%%) (Range). In a ranged attack, the defender can't strike back unless it has ![](%%Range%%) (Range).

# Ready/Exhausted
A face-up character is either Ready (upright) or Exhausted (sideways). Only ready characters can attack. If an effect readies a character that is already ready, or exhausts a character that is already exhausted, just ignore that part of the effect (but do the rest of it).

# Recover
Your face-down characters automatically recover during your Recovery Phase. Some card effects can also recover a character. When a character recovers, turn it face up, but leave it exhausted.

**Note:** Recovering a character does not heal any wounds from it.

# Regeneration  
At the start of your turn, heal a wound from this character. *(The character must be face up.)*  
  

# Relationship  
The chosen characters can team attack with each other and can't be struck back while team attacking with each other.  When a character in the **Relationship** leaves play, the **Relationship** ends.
  
# Remove from the Game
Some effects say to remove a card from the game. When this happens, set it aside out of play (not in a KO pile). Usually, a card that's been removed from the game is permanently gone, but some effects could allow the card to come back.

# Resource Row
Your resource row will consist of face-down cards and Locations. Cards in your resource row count as resources whether they're face up or face down.

You can rearrange your resource row at any time, as long as your opponent can see how many you have and which Locations you have. 

You can look at your own face down resources at any time. You can't look at enemy face-down resources.

# Reveal
When a card tells you to reveal cards from your deck or hand, you must show them to each other player.

# Running Out of Cards
If you need draw a card, but your deck is empty, you just skip those draws and play continues as normal. But if all players are out of cards and no one is willing or able to attack to put wounds onto Main Characters, the player with the fewest wounds on his Main Character wins the game. If two or more players are tied for the fewest wounds, the game ends in a tie between those players.

# Safeguard  
 Characters without Safeguard in the same row as this character cannot be attacked.  

# Searching (and Shuffling)
Whenever you search your deck, shuffle it after you've finished.

# Shifting Loyalties
At the end of your turn, if there is an enemy (Brotherhood), (Resistance), or (X-Men) character on more than one side, Shifting Loyalties will trigger once for each side. First you’ll get to choose which side your character moves to. Once there it will lose its (H.A.M.M.E.R.) affiliation, so the remaining times **Shifting Loyalties** had triggered won’t do anything.

^(Source: Rule insert)  

# Shrink  
When this character gets attacked for the first time each turn, you may cancel the combat.  

# Side Decks (aka Side Stacks or Side Piles)
Certain cards allow or require you to create an additional deck outside of your 60-card + Main Character deck. Technically these are referred to as "Side Decks" but may be casually referred to as "Side Stacks" or "Side Piles." The term "Side Stacks" has gained in popularity as a side reference to the VS 2PCG community member and content creator [C_Stacks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf1_6QRrgfjP8Ts3dxJ6bBg) for whom the continued addition of additional Side Decks has been particularly irritating. :)

Side Stacks may include, but are not limited to, the following stacks (and cards that result in those stacks):

- Absorption History Stack (Mimic MC) 

- Agenda Stack (Syndicate) 

- Battleworld Stack (Battleworld game type and The Grandmaster Main Character)

- Behind the Camera Stack (Mandarin MCU)

- Clone Stack (Scarlet Spider)

- Echo Stack (Hope Summers)

- Facehugger Stack (Ovomorph)

- Gift Stack (Mattie Franklin)

- Graduation Stack (Professor X MC)

- Hound Stack (Ahab)

- Hostage Stack (Secret Hideout)

- Invention Stack (Doctor Doom, Mister Fantastic, The Maker)

- Lizard Stack (Dr. Curt Connors)

- Spellbook Stack (Willow)

- Spider Web Stack(Scarlet Spider)

- Tactics Stack (Mastermind)

- Ultron Facility Stack (Ultron MCU MC)

- Wish Stack (Jenn)
  

#  [Sinister Six](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2018/07/vs-system-2pcg-sinister-syndicate-card-preview-sinister-sickness/)  
  
Your Sinister Six pile consists of exactly six main characters with the Sinister Six keyword.  At the start of the game when all players would reveal your main character (after choosing first player) you reveal your Sinister Six pile instead.  Then you choose which character from your Sinister Six pile will start the game in play.  
  
If this character is a main character and gets KO'd while your Sinister Six pile is not empty, you don't lose the game.  Instead, remove it from the game and at the start of your next turn put another character with Sinister Six from your Sinister Six pile onto your side.  This power can't be turned off.  If a newly arrived Sinister Six MC has the same name as a supporting character on your side, that SC will be KO’d.  
  

# Slayer  
 When this character is melee attacking, if it wounds an Evil supporting character, remove it from the game.  
  

# Sniper  
 This character can ranged attack back row characters even while they're protected.  
  

# Soldier  
 When this character appears, put -1/-1 counters equal to the number of Soldiers on your side onto an enemy supporting character.  

---

Q: Does the target of the **Soldier** ability have to be unprotected? The card doesn't mention this, but the S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra rule book does.

A: No, it can be any supporting character. This was a misprint in the rule book.

# Spells and Spellcasters
**Spells** are Plot Twists that require a specific type of **Spellcaster** character on your side to pay a specific power symbol. For example, Growth is a ![](%%Might%%) (Might) **Spell**. To play it, a ![](%%Might%%) (Might) **Spellcaster** on your side such as Magik must pay a ![](%%Might%%) (Might). 

Other than the above requirements, **Spells** work just like any other Plot Twists.

**Note:** If a **Spell** is playable in combat, the **Spellcaster**who casts it does *not* have to be in combat.

^(Source: Rule Insert)  

---

Q: Is Spellcaster a keyword power or is it a super power or is it something else entirely?

A: Spellcaster is a keyword power. (Actually, it’s a family of keyword powers -- see next question.)

Q: If an effect tells me to “name a keyword power” do I just name “Spellcaster” or do I have to say a specific type of Spellcaster?

A: You have to name the specific type of Spellcaster. There are currently four different types of Spellcaster and each one is a separate keyword power:

![](%%Energy%%) (Energy) Spellcaster

![](%%Intellect%%) (Intellect) Spellcaster

![](%%Might%%) (Might) Spellcaster

![](%%Skill%%) (Skill) Spellcaster

So for example you could name "Might Spellcaster.”

Q: Is **Spell** a keyword power? Can plot twists even have keyword powers?

A: Yes and yes. **Spell** is a family of (currently) four keyword powers just like **Spellcaster**. Some other examples of keyword powers on plot twists are **Loyalty** and **Agenda**. (Note: Similar to Spells and Spellcaster, each type of Loyalty is actually a separate keyword.)

# Spider-Gear  
 This Equipment can only be equipped to a character with “Spider” in its name.  
  

#  [Spider-Verse](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2019/12/vs-system-2pcg-crossover-vol-2-card-preview-into-the-multiverse/)  
  
If you choose a Spider-Verse character to be your starting main character, you may include up to four other Spider-Verse main characters in your deck.  

During your Build Phase, if this character is in your hand, you may put it onto your side.  This doesn't count as recruiting the character.  
  
These characters **do** count toward your total of 60 cards in your deck. You don’t have to include any Spider-Verse main characters in your deck, but you can include up to four.  As a reminder, if you have multiple main characters, they must all be KO'd for you to lose the game.  

# Start of Game
Some cards or abilities refer to "At the start of the game..." Some of those cards include qualifiers like "...before players draw their opening hands." However, if the card doesn't include such a qualifier, the game starts after the game set up has been completed. 

Setting up the game ends after both players have drawn their opening hands (including mulligans, if applicable).

# Stealth  
 This character can melee attack back row characters even while they are protected.

# Strike
When one character strikes another, you compare its ATK value to the enemy's DEF value. If they are equal or the ATK value is greater, the enemy is stunned. A character must have at least 1 ATK to be able to strike.

Striking occurs most commonly during combat. However, there are also powers and effects that allow one character to strike another outside of combat or before the combat resolves.

This entry isn't intended to cover all possible striking scenarios, but a few key points to keep in mind:

**Striking in combat:** 
Striking occurs when you hit the "Combat Resolution" substep of the Combat phase. If the defender is in a position to strike back, both the attacker's and defender's strikes will typically happen simultaneously. (Keep in mind that powers and effects such as **Ferocious** change this typical scenario.)

**Striking outside of combat:**
If a character power or card ability allows you to strike a character outside of combat, the defending character does not strike back. You still compare the ATK to DEF value, and the striking character must still have at least 1 ATK in order to strike.

**Multiple strikes at once:**
Some powers or card abilities (such as **A Necessary Evil**) allow a character to strike more than once. If an attacker is striking multiple times, typically you just add the striker's ATK value for the number of strikes. For example, **A Necessary Evil** allows an attacker to strike an additional time. So, if the attacker had an ATK value of 5, that attacker would instead strike for 10. 

If a defender is able to strike multiple times, you can either strike the same attacker multiple times (add the ATK value) or strike multiple attackers. For example, let's say you are team-attacked by 2 attackers. If you have 5 ATK and an ability that allows you strike twice during that combat, you could either A.) strike the same attacker twice (total of 10 ATK) or B.) Strike each defender once with 5 ATK.

---

Q: If I have an ability that allows me to directly strike a character, can I strike a face-down character?

A: The short answer is "yes," but depending on the scenario it might not really do anything. Check out the [glossary entry for Hide](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_hide) for further details.
  
# Stun/Stunned
When a character is defeated in combat, or if a characters DEF is ever reduced to 0 (whether from -1/-1 counters or some other effect), it gets stunned. Remove all +1/+1 or -1/-1 counters from it, KO any Equipment on it, turn it face down exhausted, and place a wound counter on it. If it now has wounds greater than or equal to its health, it's KO'd and put into its owner's KO pile.

A stunned character can't attack or defend, doesn't protect anyone in a row behind it, and loses its powers (until it recovers). 

If a character gets stunned by an effect during combat but before the combat resolves, it is removed from the combat.

Any player can look at any stunned character at any time.

# Super Power
A power on a character that they use by turning a Location face down or discarding a Location from your hand.

# Survives  
A character is considered to have survived if it made it through combat resolution without getting stunned. This includes Ferocious combat resolution and normal combat resolution. Anything that is looking to trigger on Stun/KO and surviving would check at both resolutions. If a trigger is looking back to find out who survived, the character must have survived in both Ferocious combat and normal combat. It does not count if a combat is cancelled early due to an effect or missing attacker/defender. Combat must resolve normally in order for a character to “survive.”  
  

# Swarm  
You can have any number of characters with this character's name on your side. This power can't be turned off.  
  

# Symbiosis  
 This character can have and gain +1/+1 counters while stunned.  

# Team Affiliation  
The team or teams to which this character belongs. Typically the team affiliation is indicated by the icon in the upper-right corner of the card, though there are cards that can grant or remove affiliations. Team Affiliation is *not* lost when the character is face-down.

---

Q: If team affiliation isn't lost when the character is face-down, does that mean I can play plot twists for a given team affiliation even if all my characters on that team are face-down?

A: No. Though they keep their team affiliation when face-down, you must have a face-up character with that team affiliation in order to play a plot twist of that affiliation. (Though there are some characters with powers that can circumvent this requirement).

> Some plot twists have a team/brand symbol on the top right of the card. That means you may only play it if you have a face-up character with that team/brand symbol on your side (including your main character). However, you can use it to affect any character regardless of team/brand symbol.

^(Source: Official Rulebook)

# Timing
When you play a Plot Twist, use a Super Power, or Power Up a character, it resolves its effect before anyone can take an action. If a power "triggers" in the middle of another action, resolve that action first then resolve the power that triggered. If multiple powers trigger at the same time, the player whose turn decides the order to resolve them.

# Token  
Some cards have the type "Token" under the card's name.  Some examples are "Monkey Joe" SC token for Squirrel Girl or "Alien Symbiote" Equipment token for Black Suit Spider-Man MC.  These cards cannot be included in your deck.  Instead, if you have a card in your deck that has an effect that would bring the token into play, you include it in a side deck much like your Main Character.  They do not count toward the 60-card limitation of the deck.  
  
* If a token leaves play for any reason, it is returned to the side deck.  
  
* If a token is KO'd, it will go to the KO pile and trigger any effects that would normally fire from this event but it is then immediately removed from the game and sent back to the side deck.  
  
* The cost on a token is only used as a reference for other card effects such as Yondu SC from the base set who can stun an SC with cost 3 or less.  You will not need to pay this cost to bring the token into play.  
  
* If you gain control of an effect that would bring a token into play, you will ignore that part of the effect since you do not have the associated tokens in a side deck.  Example: You control Taskmaster and your opponent controls an Ovomorph, Taskmaster's keyword will cause him to gain the Ovomorph's Hatch keyword but its effect will be ignored since it references a side deck you do not have.  
  
* You cannot include a token in a side deck unless you have included the card that would bring it into play.  Example: if your Taskmaster gained an enemy Ovomorph's "Hatch" keyword but you also have an Ovomorph in your deck (and therefore have a Facehugger pile to pull from), then Hatch will resolve normally.  
  

# Tough  
When this character gets stunned, you may recover it. *It still gets a wound.*  
  

# Transform  
When a character transforms it means they are being replaced with a different character. Remove them from the game and put the new character into play in the same orientation (ready/exhausted) they were in. Move all counters and equipment from them onto the new character, apply any modifiers (such as Freeze) to the new character.  

# Uniqueness
**You can only have one character with a specific name on your side at one time.** If you play a character with the same name as one that's already on your side, then you must KO the first one. If they both enter play simultaneously, then you must pick one to KO. If the second one ends up on your side through some special effect (e.g., Mind Controlling an enemy character), then you still must KO the first character.

The only exception to all of this is your Main Character. You may never control a character with the same name as your Main Character. If an effect would cause that, ignore that part of the effect. You can't play a Supporting Character with the same name as your Main Character. Discarding a Supporting Character from your hand to Power Up a character on your side is not considered "playing" that character.

**Note: ** You can have more than one character with a specific name if it has the **Swarm** keyword.
  

# Vampire  
When this character KOs a defending character in melee combat and survives, put a Vitality counter on it.  
  

# Violent  
While attacking a supporting character, this character strikes with double its ATK.  

---

Q: If I get Violent multiple times, does it stack? For example, if my character has 4 ATK and I have Violent twice, do I have 8 or 16 ATK?

A: See similar question for [Fearless](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_fearless).
  
  
# Vitality Counter
A vitality counter is essentially the opposite of a wound counter. It gives a character +1 Health and remains on the character while the character is stunned. However, if a character has both a wound counter and vitality counter, they cancel out – remove one of each until the character only has one type.

**Example:** A character has 2 vitality counters. It gets stunned and gains a wound. You’ll now remove one vitality counter and one wound counter. It now has 1 vitality counter left.

# Wealthy  
 At the start of your Build Phase, gain a recruit point.  
  

#  [Wish](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2019/11/vs-system-2pcg-the-x-files-battles-card-preview-5/)  
  

* This ability only exists on the X-Files supporting character Jenn.  If Jenn is in your deck, you start the game with a Wish pile. When you make your deck, choose three different cards and put two copies of each of them into your Wish pile. Here are the rules for which cards you can choose:  
  
* You can't choose Tokens, Main Characters or Locations.  
  
* You can't choose cards that start the game in unique piles (like [Agendas](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_agenda)) or cards that require a pile of their own.  
  
* You *can* choose cards that couldn't normally start in your deck, like Illustrated Universe cards and other teams' Loyalty cards.  
  
* You *can* choose copies of cards that are already in your deck, even if your deck already has the maximum number of those cards.  
  
* During setup, put your Wish pile out of play and face down. It’s a private pile. (you do not need to show your opponents what’s in it, but you can look at it at any time.)  
  
* When you make a Wish, remove both copies of any card in your Wish pile from the game, and choose an enemy player. While those cards are removed this way, you may play one and that player may play one.  
  
* If the cards are Equipment or Plot Twists both of you may ignore any team affiliation play restrictions on them. If a card would be put into a KO pile, it goes to its owner’s (your) KO pile.

# Wounds (and Wound Counters)
When a character becomes stunned, it gains a wound. If it has as many (or more) wounds as its health, it gets KO'd. Some card effects say to "wound a character." In this case put a wound counter on it, but it doesn't get stunned.

Wound Counters interact with Vitality Counters in the same way that +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters work together. If a card has both Wound and Vitality Counters, they cancel one another out until only one type remains.

# XP (and XP Counters)
Most Main Characters can gain XP counters to ultimately level up into another version of that character. XP counters are placed on the next level of that character in the Level Up zone - not on the version of the Main Character currently in play.
