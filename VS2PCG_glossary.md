  
# Common Glossary and FAQ of Keywords and Effects    

Here is the list of the most common recurring keywords, powers or terms that are listed but not always defined on the card.  This list is also being updated to include general FAQs about some of these keywords.
  

#  Absorption History
  See the [card-specific clarification for Mimic (MC)](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_mimic_.28mc.29).
  

# Agenda  
  

* When you build a deck with a starting Main Character with the printed Syndicate team affiliation, you must choose ONE Syndicate Agenda. It will start the game out of play face down in your Agenda pile.  
  
* Your Agenda does not count toward your 60-card deck.  
  
* Your Agenda pile is private. (Your opponents can’t look at it, but you can look at it at any time.)  
  
* While it’s in your Agenda pile, you can play it just like a normal Plot Twist, and after it resolves put it into your KO pile. (Once it goes to your KO pile, it works just like any other Plot Twist. For example, if you somehow get it back into your hand, you can play it again.)  
  

# Agent  
   When this character appears, look at cards from the top of your deck equal to the number of Agents on your side.  Put any of them on the bottom of your deck.  
  

# AKA [name]  
This character is also considered to have the name specified.  This is not considered a power.  
  

# Amortal   
This power currently only exists on the [*Death* Main Character](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_death).
 
See also [July 2019 Rules Update](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y95RZDM2Ualcn__Z87UTj9kvFgiXk73N/view?fbclid=IwAR2fMgAc9SM3uLepVY2dO1MWQzSHJoBztx7gD9VR3IhbogRIIPBe8upAotw) for full details  
  

# Amplify  
If you discard the location from your hand to power this super power you gain the text after the word Amplify.  
  

# Angry  
This character must be in your first attack each turn if able.  (It can be a team attack.)  
  

# Ban  
Name a character and choose a number.  Put all supporting characters with that name on enemy sides into their owner's hands.  For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players' sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles have a cost equal to the chosen number and nothing can ever, ever change that.  
  

# Berserker  
When this character attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on it  
  

# Biosentinel  
 The Biosentinel keyword does nothing by itself and is instead referenced by other powers.  
  

# Bulletproof  
  Characters with Range can't strike this character. *(Even in melee combat.)*  
  

# Burn  
   Stun this character at the end of each of your turns.  
  

# Capture  
Remove the captured character from the game but keep track of any wound counters on it.  When the captor leaves play, put its captive back into play stunned in its owner's back row.  
  

#  Card Game
 This is a power currently available on [Wyatt Wingfoot](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_wyatt_wingfoot).
 
To summarize, Wyatt will draw cards into his own "hand" and place resources into his own "resource row" that can be used to recruit during his own recruit step to bring cards onto your side.  When Wyatt leaves play or changes sides, his hand and resource row are removed from the game.  
  

# Card Title  
 The name of a card on the name line (ignoring AKAs).  
  

# Climb  
At the start of your Main Phase, you may exhaust a location on your side. If you do, put a +1/+1 counter on this character.  
  
Exhausted Locations can still be flipped face-down to pay for super powers but a face-down Location cannot be climbed (it is not counted as a location while face-down).  Exhausted Locations also do not generate Recruit Points but with Climb they will recover before the start of the Build Phase anyway so that is a non-issue.  
  

# Collect  
  
Remove the chosen character from the game. You may only collect a character with a different team affiliation from every other character you've collected this game.  A collection is unique to a player.  
  

# Combat Master  
While this character is in combat, enemy players can't play plot twists.  
  

# Comet Fall  
 When this character appears, put a -1/-1 counter on each enemy character.  
  

# Creature  
This character cannot be equipped.  
  

# Daze  
Stun the character, but it doesn't get a wound.  
  

#  Deconstruct the Universe
[See the specific-card clarification page](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_dark_phoenix_.28sc.29) for details on this keyword that only exists on Dark Phoenix Supporting Character that reads: *"When you recruit Dark Phoenix, you may remove one of the following concepts from the game:"*  
  
# Dimensional Wristwatch  
You may recruit this character from your deck. (Search your deck for them, shuffle, then recruit them.)  
  
In tournament play, you're only allowed to search for and fail to find a character with this keyword once.  After that you're just shuffling your deck for free and it is frowned upon.  
  

# Dodge  
This character cannot be Range attacked  
  

# Duplicate  
A Duplicate has all the same printed characteristics as your Main Character – name, team, current Level, and powers with an ATK/DEF of 0/1 and 1 Health – plus it has Swarm and it can’t gain XP, can’t Level up or Level Down, transform, or otherwise become a different card. When it’s KO’d it will go back to being the Parallel Dimension Plot Twist in your KO pile.  
  

# Durable  
If this character would get stunned other than by getting struck in combat, it doesn't get wounded. When this character gets stunned other than by getting struck in combat, you may recover it.  

# Equipment
Equipment is a type of card that is attached to character and gives it powers. During your turn you can put Equipment cards onto your characters by paying the cost just like a character. Just like an affiliated plot-twist, you can only play an equipment if you have a face-up character with the matching team/brand affiliation; however that equipment can go on any character you control. See [Playing Equipment in the Official Rules](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1nF6Wh6sNSTgopLu9-3p4P58LSq-pC-bxInOnBTvhRwc/mobilebasic#h.aexu5x31ppi) for more information.

--- 

Q: When a character is a different team affiliation than an equipment that is attached to them. Can you use the character’s ‘wild’ location to pay the Equipment's power? Or does it have to be the Equipment-affiliated ‘wild’ location?

For example, if Misty Knight (Defenders) is using a Net Launcher can she use the Sanctum Sanctorum (Defenders wild location) to pay for it?

A: It would be the wild location for the character, not the equipment. So Misty could use Sanctum Sanctorum to pay the cost for its power.

# Eternal  
If this character would leave play, you may put them into their owner's hand instead.  
  

# Errata  
Name a character.  For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players' sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles lose and can't gain powers. *(Including Flight and Range)*  

This ability is currently available on the [Deadpool MC from the Deadpool & Friends set](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_deadpool_.28mc_-_underworld.29).

# Evil 
Classification of a card's affiliation on the scale of [Good or Evil](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/good_or_evil). Used for some game formats or card abilities/effects.

# Fearless  
 While attacking a main character, this character strikes with double its ATK.  
  

# Ferocious  
While in melee combat, this character strikes before characters without Ferocious.  
  

# Flight  
This character can attack protected characters in the back row unless there is a face-up character with Flight in the enemy front row.  
  

# Freeze  
Exhaust a character.  That character can't Ready during its next turn.  

---
Q: If a player is frozen...can they still climb?

A: Frozen only stops readying, so yes

# Friendly  
This character cannot attack. (Note: Unlike **Passive**, this character can strike back.)  
  

# Genius  
 At the start of your turn, draw a card.  
  
Like all powers, Genius is only active while face-up.  Some cards with Genius call this out specifically in their text while others don't but it is true in either case.  

# Good
Classification of a card's affiliation on the scale of [Good or Evil](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/good_or_evil). Used for some game formats or card abilities/effects.
  
# Grab  
 While this character is in the front row, enemy characters can't fly over him.  
  

# Graduate  
 Functionally the same as [Transform](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_transform)  
  

# Hex  
 Enemy main characters can't level up. *(They still gain XP.)*  
  

# Hide  
 Turn this character face-down but Ready.  He doesn't count as being stunned.  
  
Hidden characters still lose powers, Equipment and +1/+1 or -1/-1 counters.  
  
Hidden characters will turn face up in the Recovery phase.  
  
Hidden characters can't be attacked without special effects allowing attacks on a face-down character.  If attacked or struck, a hidden character can still be stunned and wounded normally.  
  

#  [Hologram](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2020/02/vs-system-2pcg-friendly-neighborhood-card-preview-you-dont-want-any-part-of-this-or-do-you/)  
Each Hologram has an associated power symbol. If an enemy character with that type of Super Power appears, it automatically stuns the Hologram.  
  

#  Hostage
For a full breakdown, see the [Sinister Syndicate Special Location Secret Hideout](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_secret_hideout) section of the card-clarification page. 
  

# Hunter  
This character gets +3 ATK while attacking.  
  

# Immobile  
 This character can't move during the formation step.  
  

# Infinity  
If a card with Infinity would get put into a KO pile from anywhere, you may shuffle it into its owner's deck instead. [July 2019 Rules Update](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y95RZDM2Ualcn__Z87UTj9kvFgiXk73N/view?fbclid=IwAR2fMgAc9SM3uLepVY2dO1MWQzSHJoBztx7gD9VR3IhbogRIIPBe8upAotw)  
  

# Inspire  
When another character appears on your side, put a +1/+1 counter on it.  
  

# Invade  
While this character is attacking a back row character, it can't strike back at him.  
  

#  [Invention](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2020/04/vs-system-2pcg-the-fantastic-battles-card-preview-fantastic-stories/)  
If you have any characters that can create an Invention (inventors) in your deck, you get a single Invention pile (even if you have multiple different inventors in your deck).  
  
* Invention piles are secret (only you know their contents).  
  
* The Invention pile contains copies of each Invention card without a team affiliation and copies of each Invention card that shares a team affiliation with an inventor in your deck.  
  
* The quantity of each card is equal to its Invention number (the number in parentheses after Invention).  
  
* When a character on your side creates an Invention, secretly choose an Invention card from your Invention pile that either has no team affiliation or that shares a team affiliation with the inventor and put it into your hand.  
  

# Invisibility  
At the end of your turn, if this character is ready, you may [hide](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_hide) her.  
  
# Keyword
Keywords are powers that often show up on more than one character. When a character has a keyword power, just follow the instructions in its text. (Some common or older keywords might not have their text displayed. In that case, you can look up their definition in this Rulebook.)

Flight and Ranged are the two most common keyword powers.

---

Q: Is there a distinction between Keyword Text and Keyword Powers? I ask because [Dark Phoenix's](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_dark_phoenix_.28sc.29) **Deconstruct the Universe** can disable Keyword Text, but she doesn't disable **Flight** or **Range** when doing so. 

A: In this case, **Flight** and **Range** are just two specific exceptions of Keywords that are not affected by **Deconstruct the Universe**. So, there is not a meaningful distinction between "Keyword Powers" and "Keyword Text".

# Invisible  
This character doesn’t protect characters and can attack protected characters.  
  

# Leader  
 While this character is team attacking, you choose who the defender strikes back against.  
  

# Leap  
This character has Flight on your turn.  
  

# Legion  
You may include up to eight copies of this card in your deck.  
  

# Lethal  
If this character wounds a defending supporting character, KO it. *(Lethal's text received errata to trigger on wound and not stun as is written on some older cards.)*  
  

# Loyalty  
Put this in your deck only if each card with a team affiliation and each character in your deck share a team affiliation. [July 2019 Rules Update](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y95RZDM2Ualcn__Z87UTj9kvFgiXk73N/view?fbclid=IwAR2fMgAc9SM3uLepVY2dO1MWQzSHJoBztx7gD9VR3IhbogRIIPBe8upAotw)

As of the [June 2020 Rules update](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2020/06/vs-system-2pcg-rules-changes-and-clarifications-june-2020/), the following applies:
Currently, if you want to build a Loyalty deck, all your out-of-game piles must also follow any Loyalty restrictions.

From now on, that rule will be removed:

**Out-of-game piles do NOT need to follow Loyalty restrictions.**

Some examples of what this change will allow:

-   You can now play a Mister Fantastic or Doctor Doom Loyalty deck with an Invention pile.
-   You can now play Dr. Curt Connors (with his Lizard pile) in a Spider-Friends Loyalty deck.
-   You can now use a Secret Hideout (with its Hostage pile) in a Sinister Syndicate Loyalty deck.

# Lumbering  
As this character attacks, the defending player chooses who the defender is. (It must be a character that it could attack.)  
  

# Machine  
Some equipment cards are labeled "Equipment - Machine" beneath their card names.  
  
* If a Machine has a team affiliation, you still need to have a face-up character with that team affiliation symbol on your side (including your Main Character) to play it.  
  
* Machines are not equipped to characters.  Instead put the Machine into one of your rows (the same way you would put a character into a row.)  
  
* Machines can't be rearranged during your Formation Step.  
  
* If there are no face-up characters in a Machine's row, the Machine can be attacked.  A Machine can only be attacked by an enemy character that could normally attack a character in that row.  For example, if a Machine is in your back row, and you have a face-up character in your front row, the Machine can only be attacked be an enemy character that is using an effect like Flight, Stealth or Sniper to avoid your front row character.  
  
* Machines don't protect characters (or other Machines) and never count as being protected.  
  
* When a Machine gets attacked, KO it. (This happens right away.  For example, players won't be able to play Plot Twists and the attacker doesn't "strike" the machine.)  
  
* If a Machine stops being an Equipment for any reason, it also is no longer a Machine.  
  

# Mantle  
A card "shares a mantle" with another card when there are two or more cards in the game with that name, but one of them has one or more stars in the name line.  
  
Cards sharing a mantle are considered to have different names, and if an effect refers to one of them, it will not apply to the other.  
  
For Example: [Captain America](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-015.jpg) and [\*Captain America\*](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SVH-043.jpg) share a mantle.  Both can be on the field at the same time but cannot power each other up because their names are different.  Also because their names are considered to be different, [Jack Flag](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-009.jpg) cannot team attack with \*Captain America\* because his text only refers to Captain America (without the stars).  

# Mercenary
This character can team attack with any Main Character.

---

Q: If I have both Hit Monkey and Masacre, can they both team attack with my Main Character at the same time?

A: In this case, yes. Because Hit Monkey and Masacre are both on the same team already, they can both use their **Mercenary** ability to team attack with your Main Character. However, if you have two supporting characters with **Mercenary** who aren't on the same team (such as Silver Sable and Hit Monkey), they cannot *simultaneously* team attack with your main character.

# Mobile  
Once per turn during your Main Phase but not during combat, you may move this character to your front row or back row.  
  

# Monstrous  
 While this character is defending against a melee team attack, he strikes back against each attacker.  
  

# Nerf  
Name a character.  For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players' sides and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles are 0/1 with 1 Health and nothing can ever, ever change that.  

This ability is currently available on the [Deadpool MC from the Deadpool & Friends set](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_deadpool_.28mc_-_underworld.29).  

# Nest  
  

* This keyword only exists on the Main Character L2 Hawkeye from MCU Heroes and has the following rules:  
  
* When you spend a power symbol from a Location in your resource row to put Hawkeye into a Nest, you put the Location card partly underneath him and leave it  face up as the Nest. (Note that if you pay for the power by discarding a Location or you reduce the cost of the power to zero power symbols, nothing happens.)  
  
* While a Location is a Nest, it still counts as a Location and as being a face-up resource in your resource row, however it can’t be used to generate a power symbol any more. (So it does generate a resource point.)  
  
* If the Location gets KO’d or leaves your side, the Nest effect ends.  
  
* If the Location gets turned face down by an effect, put it back into your resource row and the Nest effect ends.  
  
* When Hawkeye gets stunned or leaves your side, turn the Location face down and put it into your resource row.  
  
* If Hawkeye uses I Want You On That Roof while he already has a Nest, turn the old Nest face down and put it into your resource row.  
  

# Noble  
While defending, this character strikes with double its ATK.  
  

# One of a Kind  
You may only include one copy of this card in your deck.  
  

# Passive  
This character cannot attack and cannot strike back.  
  

#  Pocket Universe
Summary: Move each other character (everyone but Franklin) to a Pocket Universe. This creates a new front and back row for each player that cannot interact with cards in another "universe."  After each of your turns, take a turn controlling cards in each Pocket Universe you have created.  The Pocket Universe turns skip the Draw and Build phases.  
  
See the [Franklin Richards section of the card-specific clarifications page](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rules-insert#wiki_franklin_richards).
  

# Pounce  
While this character is attacking an exhausted character, it can't strike back at her.  
  

#  [Prediction](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2020/05/vs-system-2pcg-the-fantastic-battles-card-preview-dooms-day/)  
  

* When you make a Prediction, secretly write down the name of two characters: an attacker and a defender. The names don’t have to be characters in play at the time Mad Thinker uses the super power.  
  
* When a character with the attacker’s name attacks a character on your side with the defender’s name (even in a team attack), cancel the combat. Then make another Prediction about the same turn, but this time you’ll have a lot more data! You can make a maximum of two Predictions from each use of the super power.  
  

# Range  
This character can make Ranged attacks from the back row and can strike back when defending from a Ranged attack.  
  

# Regeneration  
  

* At the start of your turn, heal a wound from this character. *(The character must be face up.)*  
  

# Relationship  
  

* The chosen characters can team attack with each other and can't be struck back while team attacking with each other.  
  

# Safeguard  
  

* Characters without Safeguard in the same row as this character cannot be attacked.  
  

# Shrink  
  

* When this character gets attacked for the first time each turn, you may cancel the combat.  
  

#  [Sinister Six](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2018/07/vs-system-2pcg-sinister-syndicate-card-preview-sinister-sickness/)  
  

* Your Sinister Six pile consists of exactly six main characters with the Sinister Six keyword.  At the start of the game when all players would reveal your main character (after choosing first player) you reveal your Sinister Six pile instead.  Then you choose which character from your Sinister Six pile will start the game in play.  
  
* If this character is a main character and gets KO'd while your Sinister Six pile is not empty, you don't lose the game.  Instead, remove it from the game and at the start of your next turn put another character with Sinister Six from your Sinister Six pile onto your side.  This power can't be turned off.  If a newly arrived Sinister Six MC has the same name as a supporting character on your side, that SC will be KO’d.  
  

# Slayer  
  

* When this character is melee attacking, if it wounds an Evil supporting character, remove it from the game.  
  

# Sniper  
  

* This character can ranged attack back row characters even while they're protected.  
  

# Soldier  
  

* When this character appears, put -1/-1 counters equal to the number of Soldiers on your side onto an enemy supporting character.  

---

Q: Does the target of the **Soldier** ability have to be unprotected? The card doesn't mention this, but the S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. Hydra rule book does.

A: No, it can be any supporting character. This was a misprint in the rule book.

# Spider-Gear  
  

* This Equipment can only be equipped to a character with “Spider” in its name.  
  

#  [Spider-Verse](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2019/12/vs-system-2pcg-crossover-vol-2-card-preview-into-the-multiverse/)  
  

* If you choose a Spider-Verse character to be your starting main character, you may include up to four other Spider-Verse main characters in your deck.  
  
* During your Build Phase, if this character is in your hand, you may put it onto your side.  This doesn't count as recruiting the character.  
  
* These characters **do** count toward your total of 60 cards in your deck. You don’t have to include any Spider-Verse main characters in your deck, but you can include up to four.  As a reminder, if you have multiple main characters, they must all be KO'd for you to lose the game.  
  

# Stealth  
  

* This character can melee attack back row characters even while they are protected.  
  

#Survives  
  

* A character is considered to have survived if it made it through combat resolution without getting stunned. This includes Ferocious combat resolution and normal combat resolution. Anything that is looking to trigger on Stun/KO and surviving would check at both resolutions. If a trigger is looking back to find out who survived, the character must have survived in both Ferocious combat and normal combat. It does not count if a combat is cancelled early due to an effect or missing attacker/defender. Combat must resolve normally in order for a character to “survive.”  
  

# Swarm  
  

* You can have any number of characters with this character's name on your side. This power can't be turned off.  
  

# Symbiosis  
  

* This character can have and gain +1/+1 counters while stunned.  

# Team Affiliation  

* The team or teams to which this character belongs. Typically the team affiliation is indicated by the icon in the upper-right corner of the card, though there are cards that can grant or remove affiliations. Team Affiliation is *not* lost when the character is face-down.

---

Q: If team affiliation isn't lost when the character is face-down, does that mean I can play plot twists for a given team affiliation even if all my characters on that team are face-down?

A: No. Though they keep their team affiliation when face-down, you must have a face-up character with that team affiliation in order to play a plot twist of that affiliation. (Though there are some characters with powers that can circumvent this requirement).

> Some plot twists have a team/brand symbol on the top right of the card. That means you may only play it if you have a face-up character with that team/brand symbol on your side (including your main character). However, you can use it to affect any character regardless of team/brand symbol.

^(Source: Official Rulebook)

# Token  
  

* Some cards have the type "Token" under the card's name.  Some examples are "Monkey Joe" SC token for Squirrel Girl or "Alien Symbiote" Equipment token for Black Suit Spider-Man MC.  These cards cannot be included in your deck.  Instead, if you have a card in your deck that has an effect that would bring the token into play, you include it in a side deck much like your Main Character.  They do not count toward the 60-card limitation of the deck.  
  
* If a token leaves play for any reason, it is returned to the side deck.  
  
* If a token is KO'd, it will go to the KO pile and trigger any effects that would normally fire from this event but it is then immediately removed from the game and sent back to the side deck.  
  
* The cost on a token is only used as a reference for other card effects such as Yondu SC from the base set who can stun an SC with cost 3 or less.  You will not need to pay this cost to bring the token into play.  
  
* If you gain control of an effect that would bring a token into play, you will ignore that part of the effect since you do not have the associated tokens in a side deck.  Example: You control Taskmaster and your opponent controls an Ovomorph, Taskmaster's keyword will cause him to gain the Ovomorph's Hatch keyword but its effect will be ignored since it references a side deck you do not have.  
  
* You cannot include a token in a side deck unless you have included the card that would bring it into play.  Example: if your Taskmaster gained an enemy Ovomorph's "Hatch" keyword but you also have an Ovomorph in your deck (and therefore have a Facehugger pile to pull from), then Hatch will resolve normally.  
  

# Tough  
  

* When this character gets stunned, you may recover it. *It still gets a wound.*  
  

# Transform  
  

* When a character transforms it means they are being replaced with a different character. Remove them from the game and put the new character into play in the same orientation (ready/exhausted) they were in. Move all counters and equipment from them onto the new character, apply any modifiers (such as Freeze) to the new character.  
  

# Vampire  
  

* When this character KOs a defending character in melee combat and survives, put a Vitality counter on it.  
  

# Violent  
  

* While attacking a supporting character, this character strikes with double its ATK.  
  

# Wealthy  
  

* At the start of your Build Phase, gain a recruit point.

* This ability only exists on the X-Files supporting character Jenn.  If Jenn is in your deck, you start the game with a Wish pile. When you make your deck, choose three different cards and put two copies of each of them into your Wish pile. Here are the rules for which cards you can choose:  
  
* You can't choose Tokens, Main Characters or Locations.  
  
* You can't choose cards that start the game in unique piles (like [Agendas](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_agenda)) or cards that require a pile of their own.  
  
* You *can* choose cards that couldn't normally start in your deck, like Illustrated Universe cards and other teams' Loyalty cards.  
  
* You *can* choose copies of cards that are already in your deck, even if your deck already has the maximum number of those cards.  
  
* During setup, put your Wish pile out of play and face down. It’s a private pile. (you do not need to show your opponents what’s in it, but you can look at it at any time.)  
  
* When you make a Wish, remove both copies of any card in your Wish pile from the game, and choose an enemy player. While those cards are removed this way, you may play one and that player may play one.  
  
* If the cards are Equipment or Plot Twists both of you may ignore any team affiliation play restrictions on them. If a card would be put into a KO pile, it goes to its owner’s (your) KO pile.
