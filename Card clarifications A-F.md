# Card clarifications and FAQs

The following card-specific information is a culmination of clarifications, rule changes, and FAQs from various sources. After each item (or series of items), there's a "Source" indicator that specifies whether the item came from:
* Rule inserts from the set
* An official FAQ doc published by Upper Deck Entertainment (UDE FAQ)
* An official rule change, clarification, or errata
* A community source, such as Facebook or Discord. (Some of these have been officially approved by UDE and, if so, are noted in the source citation). 

**Note**: There have been some minor editorial liberties taken (not all are exact quotations from the main source). These changes are mainly cosmetic or made to help understand context outside of the rule-sheet and do not fundamentally change the intent of the original text.

# [Abduction](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-037.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^XFB-037

*Set: The X-Files Battles*

The abducted character will re-enter the game with wound counters on it equal to its printed health minus one. So if it has 3 printed health, it will re-enter the game with two wounds. **Note:** This won't trigger any powers that look for "when a character gets wounded**.

# [Abomination](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu1-033.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MCU1-033

*Set: MCU Battles*
  
Abomination’s **Give Me a Real Fight!** Power forces a player’s first attack to include a specific character and the defender must be Abomination. However if either that character can’t attack or Abomination can’t be attacked, the effect does nothing. Also, the player can choose not to attack at all on their turn.

# [Adam Warlock](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-001.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: ^GAL-001, ^GAL-002

*Set: Galactic Guardians* 
 
At [Level 1](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-001.jpg), if Adam Warlock gets KO'd by getting stunned, **Prepare for Rebirth** will cause him to gain an XP and become [Level 2](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-002.jpg) while in the stunned position. (If a power like Hex prevents him from leveling up, he'll remain at Level 1 but still heal his wounds.)

*Q:   If I don’t use his Emerge power, will he recover normally during my next Recovery Phase?*

A: Yes. But he’s huge! Spend that ![](%%Might%%) (Might) and start bashing with him right away, man!

# [Agamotto](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MYS-014.jpg) 
^CardNumber: ^MYS-014

*Set: Mystic Arts*

Scenario: My opponent takes over one of my SCs with Serpent Crown. I then play Agamotto which removes powers not printed on the card. I'm confident that the opponent isn't returned to me outright (because that trigger has already resolved).

> After the recent rules revision, the powers on Serpent Crown no longer "count" as being on the equipped character. As such, Agamotto will not remove those powers (since he only affects characters, not equipment.)

> In other words, playing Agamotto will not return the stolen character to you.

But what about the second part of the  **Under Set's Control** power (When this is unequipped...)? Is that considered a Trigger or a Delayed Trigger Modifier? If it's a Trigger, I assume that this character now remains on my opponent's side, even if the Crown is removed. If it's a Delayed Trigger Modifier, I assume that the character remains on my opponent's side indefinitely if the Crown is removed while Agamotto is face up. (Hope that all makes sense.)

> Some technical answers are incoming (but it sounds like that's what you're looking for).

> It's a Delayed Trigger Modifier. Under Set's Control works as follows:

> The first sentence is a triggered effect with two modifiers -- the first is a one-shot modifier that moves the character from one side to another. The second sets up a delayed triggered modifier that waits for the Crown to become unequipped.

Do you have any tips on telling one apart from the other, as they both can contain the "When" clause?

> The visual cue is a paragraph break between the two modifiers. If there's a separation, they are two separate effects each with its own modifier(s). If there's no separation, it's a single effect with multiple modifiers.

> **Example 1: Two separate triggered effects, each with a one-shot modifier.**

> **_Cool Draw + Discard Power_**

> **When this character appears, draw a card.**

> **When this character gets KO'd, discard a card.**

> Player A plays the above character and draws a card.

> Player B plays plays Nullifier and names "_Cool Draw + Discard Power_."

> The character gets KO'd. Since the power is gone, its second sentence won't trigger and the player doesn't have to discard a card.

> **Example 2: One triggered effect which generates one one-shot modifier and one delayed trigger modifier.**

> **_Cool Draw + Discard Power_**

> **When this character appears, draw a card. When this character gets KO'd, discard a card.**

> Player A plays the above character. The one shot-modifier causes the player to draw a card. The delayed trigger modifier is set up and waits for the character to get KO'd. It exists independently from the effect that generated it.

> Player B plays Nullifier and names "_Cool Draw + Discard Power_."

> The character gets KO'd. The power is gone, but the delayed trigger modifier exists separately from the power, so it will still trigger and the player will discard a card.

# [Agatha Harkness](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-013.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FAN-013

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

If Agatha appearing on your side KOs an Agatha that was already on your side (due to uniqueness), **Ancient Sorceress** will count the Agatha that was KO'd.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# Agent Venom (Level 2 MC)
^CardNumber: ^LET-006

*Set: Lethal Protector*  

This character has a **"Level Down"** power. A **Level Down** Power works just like a **Level Up** Power, except instead of gaining XP which advances it to a higher level, it gains XP which regresses it back to a lower level. When a character gains **Level Down** XP, put an XP counter on its Main Character card that is one level lower than its current level.

**Note** Agent Venom has 6 Health, representing his increased durability and life force of the Symbiote. But Flash by himself only has 5 Health, so if Agent Venom has 5 wounds and Levels Down, Flash will get KO'd.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# Agony and Riot
^CardNumber: ^LET-009, ^LET-007

*Set: Lethal Protector*  

These characters have "stun" powers: **Assassin** and **Warrior** respectively. If they trigger their power, but area lso stunned at the same time, they **will** get their +1/+1 counters.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Ahab](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FUT-023.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FUT-023

*Set: Futures Past*

You start the game with a private out-of-game Hound pile. The pile must contain exactly 4 different supporting characters of your choice with (Brotherhood), (Resistance), and/or (X-men) who do not share any names and do not have any copies in your deck. For the game, Hounds lose their printed team affiliations, and gain the (Sentinel) affiliation.

^(Source: Rule Insert)

---

Q: Do I have to reveal the Hound when I recruit it?

A: Yes. When Ahab appears, choose a Hound, reveal it to all other players, and then put it into your hand.

# [Ajax](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-012.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MFM-012

*Set: Deadpool & Friends*  

Ajax's **Pain Tolerance** power says he can only be KO'd by fatal wounds at the end of a turn. A character has fatal wounds if it has at least as many wounds as its health. So Ajax can have any amount of wounds but won't actually get KO'd until the end of a turn.

^(Source: Rule insert)

---

Q: Does his power imply that fatal wounds at the end of the turn is the ONLY way to KO him? For example, if a character power or card effect would KO him directly (such as Simon Trask's Human Sentinel One), is he still KO'd?

A: Fatal wounds can’t KO him until end of turn. Other effects (like Simon Trask) can KO him normally.

# [Alcatraz](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HAM-019.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^HAM-019

*Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.*  

When the character in “prison” turns face up, the player who used Alcatraz decides which row on its original side it goes back to.

# Alex Krycek
## [Alex Krycek (MC)](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-022.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^XFB-022, ^XFB-023

*Set: The X-Files Battles*

**Fight or Die** can choose any random Main Character, even ones not in the combat. WE suggest rolling a die to determine which character gets stunned. If Kryceck gets stunned this way, he will get removed from combat. If a stunned Main Character is chosen, nothing happens. If a hidden Main Character is chosen, stun it.

^(Source: Rule Insert)

## [Alex Krycek (SC)](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-033.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^XFB-033

*Set: The X-Files Battles*

**We All Have a Life in Our Hands** says to choose a unique character. This counts any character that doesn't have **Swarm**. To secretly choose a character we suggest jotting its name down on a piece of paper. **Note:** If the character you chose gets KO'd but then later another character with the same name is in play, the new character does NOT count for **We All Have a Life in Our Hands**.

# [Alicia Masters](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-009.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FAN-009

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Here's an example of how her **Neo-Realistic Sculptor** works. The Thing is on your side, who has 10/6 ATK/DEF. While Alicia is also on your side, his ATK/DEF become  10/10.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Alien Symbiote](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SPF-021.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^SPF-021

*Set: Spider Friends*

>If a character that is equipped with the Alien Symbiote gains an equipment card, put the Alien Symbiote in the KO pile.

The text on Alien Symbiote says that it cannot be KO'd but the One-Equip rule in the rule book will override this text if the character is equipped with another equipment card.  Cards must explicitly (not implicitly) override game mechanics and this was ruled that it was not intended to override the one-equipment rule.

# [Alter Ego](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MCU7-019.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MCU7-019

*Set: Friendly Neighborhood*  

"Make up a new name" means you must rename a character card with something that is not already the name of a character in the Vs System 2PCG. Some examples of made-up names are "Night Monkey", "Dr. Baby", and "The Fudge".

Removing a character's current names (which also makes the character lose all its **AKA**s) and replacing it lets you get around the uniqueness rules. For example, if you change Spider-Man's name to Night Monkey, you can now play or have another copy of that Spider-Man cad in play at the same time since they have different names. (On the other hand, you can no longer discard a Spider-Man character to power up Night Monkey.)

If a character references itself in its text box, those references will also use its new name.

# [Angel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/RES-001.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: ^RES-001, ^RES-002

*Set: Resistance*  

When Angel levels up, he transforms into [Archangel](#wiki_archangel). When this happens, he keeps his orientation (ready/exhausted, face-up/face-down), all of his counters, and any effects on him. Also note Archangel doesn’t have a Level 1 version. The only way to become him normally is to start the game with (Resistance) Level 1 Angel as your Main Character.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Angel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-001.jpg)/[Angelus](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-028.jpg) (MC) 
^CardNumber: ^TBB-001, ^TBB-028

*Set: The Buffy Battles*  

Level 1 Angel and Angelus can transform between each other. However, when you build a deck you must choose either Angel or Angelus to be your starting Main Character. (You must lock in your decision at the time you build your deck, not after you see what Main Character your opponent is using.) When Angel transforms into Angelus or vice versa, he keeps his orientation (ready/exhausted, face up/face down), all of his counters (including XP), and any effects on him.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Angela](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-015.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^GAL-015

*Set: Galactic Guardians*  

**An Angel From the Heavens** makes it difficult for Angela to be solo attacked. An attacker must have ![](%%Flight%%) or ![](%%Range%%) (or both) to solo attack her. 

When Angela opens a **Bridge to Heven**, you must put each revealed character onto your side. This may cause some characters to be KO'd due to the uniqueness rules.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Annihilus](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FRI-001.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FRI-001, ^FRI-002

*Set: The Frightful*

**Lord of the Negative Zone** allows you to include up to two Negative Zone Locations in your deck. (If Mister Fantastic is in your deck your Invention pile will also include its usual two Negative Zones.)

**The Living Death That Walks** grants 1 XP for each of the listed actions. So if Annihilus attacks, strikes, and stuns a defending character, but somehow doesn't wound or KO it, he will gain 3 XP.

When Annihilus levels up, you'll shuffle his Level 1 card into your deck. While it's in your hand you may reveal it for his **Continuous Rebirth** power. (You can also discard it to Power Up Annihilus. Put the discarded card into your Level Up zone, which is where his Level 2 card started the game.

# [Anya](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-018.jpg) 
^CardNumber: ^TBB-018

*Set: The Buffy Battles*

Her **Newly Human and Strangely Literal** power ignores all stat increases including +1/+1 counters. It doesn’t remove the counters – they just have no effect this turn.

# [Archangel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/RES-002.jpg)

# [Ardina](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HER-008.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^HER-008

*Set: The Herald*  

**Clone of the Silver Surfer** refers to the "card title" Silver Surfer. This means the name at the very top of the card must be Silver Surfer. **AKA**s don't count.

^(Source: Rule insert)

If Ardina appears via some mechanism other than being recruited (such as being brought along by Lockjaw or Legacy), you do not have to pay the additional cost of wounding Silver Surfer.

*Set: The Utopia Battles*  

**Psionic Exoskeleton** is a combat power, but its effect lasts for the rest of the turn.

# Arnim Zola
## [Arnim Zola](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-001.jpg) (MC-Illustrated)
^CardNumber: ^CV1-001, ^CV1-002

*Set: Crossover* 
 
**ESP Box** takes effect once the game starts and lasts the whole game (even while Arnim Zola is stunned, after he levels up, and even after he is KO’d). You can play any Equipment as a Supporting Character, regardless of whether you have a character with a matching team affiliation. When you play one as a Supporting Character, it’s no longer an Equipment. If it has a power that references “Equipped Character,” it is its own equipped character. When the card leaves play it will go back to being an Equipment. You may still play an Equipment normally and equip it to one of your characters (including on an Equipment that you played as a Supporting Character). 

When Arnim Zola enters **A New Robot Body**, your new Equipment-turned-Main Character will have ATK/DEF equal to its cost, 1 (Health), Swarm, and it will count as its own “Equipped Character,” just like with ESP Box. When that body gets KO’d, it can use this power again to jump into another robot body, and so on. Note: if you want to use a Wild Special Location to pay for this power, it must match the team affiliation of the Main Character using this power.

1. If you understand how **I Wrote an Algorithm** works, goto 2. If not, goto 3.
2. Cool. We're done here.
3. Start by reading Part 1 of the Super Power. Then if exactly one face-up enemy character has more ATK than each other face-up enemy character, go to Part 2 of the Super Power and stun that character. Otherwise go to Part 3 and put two -1/-1 counters on each enemy character. If everything now makes sense, goto 2 above. If not, goto 3 above.

# [Astra](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FRE-011.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FRE-011

*Set: Freedom Force*

To create a **Clone** put a token copy of the chosen character onto your side. The copy has all the printed characteristics (name, team, cost, ATK/DEF, Health, powers) of that character but nothing else. It appears face up and ready and does not appear with any counters or status effects (like **Burn**). Uniqueness does apply to the token.

# Avalanche
## [Avalanche](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BOM-009.jpg) (Brotherhood)
^CardNumber: ^BOM-009

*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*  

Avalanche’s **Sustained Seismic Waves** power gets stronger each time he uses it. However, if you play a new copy of Avalanche later, the super power on that copy will start over.

Q: If I **Hypnotize** a Ripley #8 L2 that started the game as Sister Ripley, which Level 1 Character does she become? Sister Ripley or Ripley#8 level 1?

A: Ripley #8 Level 1. A character will always become the level one version of what it is.  

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel)

---
Q: Does **Hex** prevent a **Hypnotized** character from turning back into Level 2 at the start of my next turn?

A: No, Hypnotize creates a modifier with an expiration that temporarily makes a character its Level 1 version. When that modifier expires it becomes its Level 2 version again, and this is not considered Leveling up.

*Set: Power & Reality*  

To resolve the **Age of Miracles**, first choose a Supporting Character with 1 printed Health other than Baron von Strucker. Then randomly select one of the six new Keyword Powers. that character gains the new power until it leaves play. (To randomly select a power, we recommend rolling a 6-sided die where 1 is **Dark** and 6 is **Wise**.)

**Note:** If you use **Age of Miracles** more than once on the same character, it's possible for them to get the same power twice. This is great with **Dark** and **Sly**, but not great with the other powers.

# [Blackbird](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/DAR-017.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^DAR-017

*Set: Into the Darkness*

The Blackbird introduces a new kind of equipment to the game - Vehicles! When you play a Vehicle, equip it to one character like normal. But whenever you rearrange your Formation (including on the turn you played the Vehicle), you may have characters on your side get on or off the Vehicle. Choose any number up to the Vehicle's Passenger Limit (found next to "Vehicle" on its type line), put them next to each other in the same row, and equip the Vehicle to all of them. Here are more details:

- All passengers must legally be able to have the Vehicle equipped.
- If any already had an equipment, KO that equipment (because a character can only have one equipment at a time). 
	- If an equipment gets equipped to a passenger, it stops being equipped to the Vehicle, but the Vehicle is not KO'd as long as it has any other passengers.
- When you rearrange your Formation, you CAN remove passengers from the Vehicle. (They stop having it equipped to them.)
- When you're done rearranging, there must be at least one passenger.
- Put the Vehicle card close to each of its passengers and announce who is "on board."

**While a Vehicle has only one passenger, it works just like any other equipment.** If its passenger gets turned face down or leaves play, the Vehicle will get KO'd. If an effect moves the passenger to a different row, the Vehicle will move with them.

**While a Vehicle has more than one passenger, it works a little differently.** If a passenger gets turned face down or leaves play, it becomes unequipped from the Vehicle, but the Vehicle remains equipped to the other passenger(s). If all passengers do get turned face down or leave play at the same time, they all become unequipped from the Vehicle and the Vehicle gets KO'd. 

If an effect moves all passengers to a different row, the Vehicle goes with them. If an effect causes one or more passengers to be in one row and the others to be in a different row, the controller of the Vehicle chooses which group of passengers stays equipped to the Vehicle.

The X-Jet has up to four effects depending on how many passengers it has. For example, while there are exactly three face-up passengers, they will each have ![](%%Flight%%) (Flight) , +1/+1 and **Dodge**. If one passenger becomes unequipped, then the other two will now have ![](%%Flight%%) (Flight) and +1/+1.

^CardNumber: ^MMU-037, ^MMU-038

*Set: Monsters Unleashed!*  

Black Bolt’s Super Powers use the Amplify ability. When you use a Super Power, if you discard a Location (instead of turning it face-down in your resource row), you get the Amplify text. Previous Amplify Super Powers grant an effect to begin with but a larger effect if you Amplify it. Black Bolt’s powers only grant an effect if you Amplify them.

Q: If I use Black Bolt's **Sonic Whisper** and Black Bolt is Lethal (by playing "A Killer Voice" for example), will the opponent be KO'd?

A: If you are attacking, yes. Lethal only activates when attacking and when you cause a wound. Because **Sonic Whisper** is a combat ability, and stunning causes a wound, the opponent will be KO'd (barring any other effects that prevent the wound, etc.).

Q: If Satana is in play and Black Cat attacks a defender and uses **Cross their Path** to Daze that character, is it KO'd by Lethal?

A: Daze counts as stunning, but Lethal was changed to work when a wounding a defending supporting character. Since Daze does not wound, lethal is not applied.

**Personal Loyalty**  
Black Cat has often wavered between being a hero and a villain. In the game she doesn’t have a team affiliation and is neither Good nor Evil… until she’s on a side (she is neither Good nor Evil while she is in your hand, deck, or KO pile). Then if Spider-Man is your main character, he has a good influence on her and she’ll ferociously fight alongside her partner. But if he’s not your main character, she’ll go back to slinking around as a criminal.

When Blade makes a melee attack, **Vampire Hunter** gives Blade 1, 2, or 3 XP. **Note:** If the defender has **Vampire** in its name Blade will gain 3 XP whether the defender is Good or Evil.

If Blade gets turned face down while he has a Stake counter, the Stake counter will be removed (just like +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters).

**Immovable Object**  
If Blob moves for any reason (including during your Formation Step or because another effect moves him), he will be prevented from gaining an XP. At the end of Blob’s first turn of the game, he will gain an XP if he didn’t move that turn.

And his **Bounced Off His Belly** power represents projectiles getting bounced back at any ranged attackers. Note: In the event that Blob somehow had ![](%%Range%%) he would not strike back using his own ATK because Bounced Off His Belly’s strike back would override his normal strike back.

This plot twist really lets you get in the game. When you put a “Me” token onto your side, you get to choose a team affiliation and your age will determine your ATK and DEF. You’ll have Leader because you’re still in charge of your team, but don’t worry – if you get KO’d you don’t lose the game because you’re also still a player. We figure you have more questions about all this, so let’s dive in. 

* **How do you prove your age?** If you’re at a tournament you’ll need an ID with a birthday. If you don’t have one, we’ll just pretend you’re 11.  

* **Does this card have different power levels for different players depending on their age?** Yes.

Q: What happens if I use his power but the combat gets canceled?

Q: What happens if he’s team attacking and I use his power, but then he gets stunned before the combat resolves?

A: His power will still trigger and stun the defender even though Cable himself got stunned before the combat resolved. This is because once an effect resolves and creates a modifier, it is independent from the source that created it.

> If multiple characters "appear" at once, Copycat is unable to copy any of them.

With the reveal of Copycat, the question arose on her interaction with [Singularity](https://i.imgur.com/3vlwcdR.jpg).  Specifically, if multiple characters (other than Copycat) appear at once, which SC's powers, if any, does Copycat inherit?  The ruling is that if multiple triggers occur simultaneously for Copycat, she will not gain any powers.  The reasoning is that she only gains powers "until another supporting character appears on your side."  This means that when multiple characters appear at once, the duration of her effect has already expired by the time it resolves.  From head judge: "if a modifier’s duration would cause it to expire before it is created, then the modifier is never created."  Ultimately, Copycat needs only a single character to appear in order to resolve as intended.

Q: If I play a red Cosmic Cube and call "Sentinel," for example, would it remove both Alpha Combat Units and Executive Types? Or what if I called "Captain America"? Would it remove Nomad or Supreme Leader? 

A: The Cosmic Cubes mention that you can choose a card and then "... remove any number of cards with that name... " (from where depends on the specific Cube). So, the "name" in this case would include:

- Cards with the title that matches the card you chose.
- Cards with **AKA** that matches the name of the card you chose.

Q: If my opponent has H.A.M.M.E.R. Cloak on his side and I play Dagger, is she KO'd by him before she can convert the -1 counters to +1?

A: She is not KO'd. She would get the +1 counters. Here are the steps when a character is recruited:

1. Announce the name of the character.
2. The character moves from whatever zone that it is in to the Resolving Zone. At this point it is considered “recruited”.
3. If any power would trigger off a character being recruited, resolve that effect, then continue. 
4. The character moves from the Resolving Zone to the Play Zone. 
5. Any powers are now active. 
6. Process any “appears with” text. 
7. At this point the character has now appeared.

So, as of step 5, Dagger's powers are active.

Daken’s **Pheromone Control** power takes away enemy characters’ powers while they’re in melee combat with him. This will prevent triggered powers like **Shrink** or **Berserker** from triggering in the first place.

^CardNumber: ^DEF-001, ^DEF-002,  ^LEG-040

*Set: The Defenders*  

**Radar Sense**  
Daredevil, Rhino, and Juggernaut have effects that allow an enemy *character* to spend a power symbol to do something. These cards have errata to explain that it is a character (not the player) paying for these abilities. So, in theory they could use a "wild" location to pay for it (if they have an appropriate face-up character for that wild's affiliation).

**Protector of Hell's Kitchen**

Q: If I attack Daredevil with Mary Walker (Typhoid Mary) and I put a -1/-1 counter on Daredevil and one on the only character he's protecting which happens to have 1 defense (like Black Widow), KO'ing her, does Daredevil gets an XP?

A: The turn player decides the order per the rule book under "Timing." Daredevil's level up power has an intervening "if" clause, which means the condition must be true when it triggers AND when it resolves. So if the turn player decides to resolve Mary Walker's power before Daredevil's power, Daredevil will not get an XP because he won't be protecting anyone once his level up power resolves. On the other hand, if the turn player decides to resolve Daredevil's power before Mary's then Daredevil will gain an XP.

^CardNumber: ^TUB-042

*Set: Utopia Battles*

Q: Dark Beast SC2. "Pay 2 less to play evil equipment." Outside of Darkhold, how does one define "evil" equipment?

A: [Good or Evil](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/good_or_evil) affiliations are typically based on the [Team Affiliation](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_team_affiliation) of the card. 

For example: Power Loader would be Good because it has The Company team affiliation, but Omega Machine would be Evil because it is H.A.M.M.E.R. affiliated.

However, for this specific question it should be noted that Darkhold is neutral. It does require you to have a Marvel character, but Marvel isn't a Team Affiliation and doesn't make the card Good or Evil. So Darkhold - even though it can only be equipped to an Evil character -  is not Evil itself (and would *not* benefit from Dark Beast's power).

**Deconstruct the Universe**  
When Deconstructs the Universe, an entire concept of the game gets removed for the rest of the game (even if she leaves play). If, as a result of this, the wording of a card’s power is unclear, the part that is unclear does nothing. Here’s how removing each concept works: 

* **+1/+1 and -1/-1 counters:** Remove all of those counters from the game. Remove the phrases “+1/+1 counter” and “-1/-1 counter” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause these counters to enter the game in any way 
 
* **Equipment**: Remove all Equipment cards everywhere from the game. This includes all sides, decks, hands, KO piles, and Equipment that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Equipment cards but don’t currently count as Equipment (such as a face-down resource or an Equipment that has become a character via Arnim Zola’s   
**ESP Box** ). Remove the term “Equipment” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Equipment to enter the game in any way.  

* **Keyword text:** Removing this concept doesn’t affect ![](%%Flight%%) and ![](%%Range%%). Remove all Keyword text from the game, including powers that “can’t be turned off”. Remove the term “Keyword” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Keyword text to enter the game in any way.  
 
* **Levels:** All Main Characters everywhere become Level 1 if possible. Remove all remaining Level 2 and higher Main Characters from the game. Remove all Level Up Powers and XP from the game, and the terms “Level” and “XP” from all card text. Ignore any effects that would cause XP or a Level 2 or higher Main Character to enter the game in any way.  

* **Plot Twists:** Remove all Plot Twist cards everywhere from the game. This includes all decks, hands, KO piles, and Plot Twists that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Plot Twist cards but are not currently Plot Twists (such as a face-down resource). Remove the term “Plot Twist” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause a Plot Twist to enter the game in any way.  

* **Super Powers:** Remove all Super Powers from the game. Remove the term “Super Power” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Super Powers to enter the game in any way.

> Hiya kids, it’s your old pal, Deadpool. Guess what? I’m the First character in the game to go all the way to Level 4. There’s probably a break-the-fourth-wall joke in there somewhere, but I haven’t found it yet. Anyhoo, the powers that be want me to tell you that even though I’m now on two different main character cards, the (X-Men) and (Underworld) versions of me can’t level up into each other.  
> 
> It’s because a main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork. And guess what? I don’t mean to brag but I’m actually a designer now. You know all the cards in this set that you love? That’s right -- I designed them. (All the cards that you hate were designed by those other two dummies.) Designing stuff is sweet. You can pretty much do whatever you want.  
> 
> I like designing so much, I wanted to do some while I was in the game too. My new main character can **nerf** stuff, **errata** stuff, and even **ban** stuff. Check it out:  

**I'm Taking Over From These Idiot Designers**  
  
* **Nerf:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks, and KO piles are 0/1 with 1 and nothing can ever, ever change that.  

* **Errata:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles lose and can’t gain powers (including ![](%%Flight%%) and ![](%%Range%%)). 
 
* **Ban:** Name a character and choose a number. Put all supporting characters with that name on enemy sides into their owner’s hands. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles have a cost equal to the chosen number and nothing can ever, ever change that. (Except banning it again. You know the old saying: “If you really, really hate a card, ban it twice.”) Any effects that would increase or decrease what an enemy player pays to recruit a banned card are ignored.  

Here are some quick tips:  

* If you steal a character with one of those effects the effect will stop because it’s not an enemy character anymore. Yay! However, if it goes back to an enemy side the effect will turn on again. Boo!  

* When you Ban a character, you can name any number you want. Even a million bazillion. Try it, it’s fun!

* If someone tries to tell you that this isn’t really how nerfing, errata-ing, and banning works, you just take your katana and do some "development” on them, if you know what I mean.

**Man, There's Noone Left to Kill**
Q: If I’m playing with 3 or 4 players, do ALL enemy characters have to be stunned for Deadpool to gain an XP?

A: No. At the end of your turn, if any enemy player has no face-up characters, Deadpool will gain 1 XP. (If two or more players have all stunned characters, Deadpool still only gains 1 XP.)

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

Q: What’s going on with his **Oh, there’s someone! Hi there!** power?

A: If all of an enemy player’s characters are stunned, Deadpool can attack that player. If the attack stuns the player, that player is KO’d and is out of the game. (The same way as if his Main Character has been KO’d.)

Q: What does “the player counts as a supporting character” mean?

A: It means that if Deadpool is attacking you, you can play Plot Twists that would help a supporting character to increase your stats or otherwise survive the combat.

Q: What if an effect puts a +1/+1 or -1/-1 counter on me while I’m defending against Deadpool?

A: It goes on you. If this puts you to 0 DEF, you’ll get stunned (and KO’d). If it makes your stats better, that could help you survive this attack and will stick around to help you if he attacks you again on a later turn.

Q: What if I get KO’d?

A: You’re out of the game, the same way as if your Main Character got KO’d. (You do not actually lose consciousness.)

Q: After Deadpool uses his **Oh, there’s Someone! Hi there!** power, can he team attack a player?

A: No, the other characters don’t know what a player is.

# [Death](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-001.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^BLK-001, ^BLK-002
*Set: Black Order*  

Death is **Amortal** which means:

* She has no level (She is beyond such mortal trappings).  
* She starts with her card that has infinite health. (Her other card has 8 health, also known as sideways infinity.)  
* She can't be face down. If she would be turned face down, switch her with her other card instead and leave it face up. For example when she gets stunned, instead of turning her face down, switch her with her other card which will remain face up. She still suffers other effects from the stun such as losing the +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters, gaining a wound, and becoming exhausted.  
* If she would be hidden, instead switch her with her other card which will remain face up and place her in the ready position.  
* Amortal can't be turned off.
 
Since Death doesn't turn face down, she can be stunned multiple times in a single turn. However, if she takes fatal wounds she's not really defeated. She's just temporarily lost interest in this mortal battle. (The player who was using her is defeated, though.) 

**Note:** While death is technically two cards, you could slip her into a single clear card sleeve with her cards back to back. Then when she would turn face down, you can just flip her to her other "side."  

**Mistress of the Infinity Well** allows each player to draw an extra card each time you draw cards. For example, when you draw your usual two cards during your Draw Phase, you'll draw an extra one. And if you have a **Genius** in play that lets you draw a card, you'll draw an extra one then, too.

* If Devil-Slayer’s strike would stun an already-stunned character, just wound it instead.

A: No. Devil Slayer still has to follow all the other legal attack rules. He doesn't have ![](%%Flight%%) so he can't ignore the front row.

Q: Does “an exact replica” trigger once for each Doombot in play. I.e. I have MC Doom and two Doombots on my side. Doom is stunned and would be wounded. An exact replica triggers on one of my two Doombots and the MC Doom is the random card chosen. Before he would be wounded, does the second Doombots keyword trigger and I pick another card at random to have the chance to potentially prevent the wound a second time?

A: First thing to know is it, is NOT a trigger. A trigger will ALWAYS start with the words, "When, Whenever, At". This is a replacement power. In short, you can try once per Doombot.

If there are multiple Doombots, that means there are multiple modifiers trying to replace the same event. If there are multiple replacement modifiers trying to apply to the same event, you choose one to apply.

If after you processed the replacement modifier, the event no longer happens, then the rest of the replacement modifiers do nothing. If the event still would happen, then you apply another replacement modifier. You keep doing this until the event no longer happens, or you have ran out of replacement modifiers.

In the case of Doombot, the event in question is Doctor Doom being wounded. As long as he is still being wounded, you may continue to try to apply replacement modifiers.

Q: Do "Appears" powers work when character are brought into play with Dramatic Entrance? I'm not sure because it says, "put into play."

Q: How does Dramatic Entrance work if I bring a Loki 7 drop SC into play with it? Does Loki draw me a card if it was the first PT I played that turn? Or since it wasn't in play, it doesn't grant me the benefit? If it doesn't, then does the next PT I play that turn trigger Loki's Schemer power?

A: If you bring in Loki SC with Dramatic Entrance, Schemer will not trigger. At the time you PLAYED the plot twist, Loki was not in play. Once he is in play, he does not look back in time and see that you played a plot twist. Also if you play another plot twist, Schemer will still not trigger because it is not your first plot twist played this turn.

^CardNumber: ^DAR-003, ^DAR-004

*Set: Sinister Syndicate*  

**Electrocution**  
Electro introduces a new concept: remaining health. Remaining health is a character’s (Health) maximum minus its wounds. (Maximum (Health) is printed plus any bonus .) For example, when a character with 1  printed (Health) appears, it will have 1 remaining health. If a character has 3 printed (Health) and is getting +1 (Health) from an effect and has 2 wounds, its remaining health is 2 (3 + 1 – 2 = 2).

^CardNumber: ^LEG-068, ^LEG-069

*Set: Legacy*  

**Hand Experience**  
Elektra (main character) has a super power that allows you to hide her in your hand until your next turn starts. But if she somehow gets discarded from your hand, shuffled into your deck, or otherwise goes anywhere except into play, then you’ll lose the game at the start of your next turn.

^(Source: Rule insert)

Q: Can I choose Elektra to be discarded with Helmut Zemo's **Sow Distrust**?

A: While Elektra is in your hand, you do not control a Main Character. Therefore, she is a valid choice.

^(Source: Chad Daniel)

Q: If I activate Kingpin's **Underworld Boss** while Elektra is in my hand, what happens to Elektra?

A: She is demoted to a Supporting character no matter what zone she is in. From the rules: "Some effects may promote a Supporting Character to Main Character and vice versa. Unlike most modifiers, these modifiers can apply to a Main Character in any zone (or side) and continue to apply to the character even if it changes zones."

# Emma Frost
## [Emma Frost](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-005.jpg) (MC) 
^CardNumber: ^TUB-003, ^TUB-004, ^TUB-005

*Set: The Utopia Battles*  

**Keeper of Law** allows a character to strike an additional time in a combat. The character can strike two different characters once each (if they’re being team attacked, for example), or they can strike the same character twice. In the latter case, add the character’s ATK together for each strike and then compare it to the enemy’s DEF. 

Emma’s power can be used any number of times each turn. So if a character ends up being allowed to strike 3, 4, or more times, it works as above. Any number of strikes can be combined against an enemy or split amongst multiple enemies.

Q: If I have multiple characters bigger than all my opponents' characters can Enchantress get multiple XP via **Champion of Amora** in a turn?

A: It would have to have the wording "for each" somewhere in there. Since the condition is if "A" supporting character of yours is stronger than all of theirs, you get 1 XP.

# [Even the Odds](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-076.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MNB-076

*Set: The Marvel Battles*

Q: How does this card work?

A: You can use it to “reset” an enemy back to its base stats. You remove all +1/+1 counters from it and any modifiers that were affecting its base ATK and DEF are overridden or suppressed.

^(Source - UDE FAQ)

---

Q: What happens if after I play Even the Odds on a character to “reset” it, my opponent plays a Plot Twist to increase its ATK?

A: Even the Odds resets a character one time and then has no further effect. So the Plot Twist will work normally.

^(Source - UDE FAQ)

---

Q: Even the Odds targeting Blackheart. He resets to a 4/4 for the rest of the combat, yes? His power does not turn on until the next combat he becomes involved in?

A: Even the Odds creates a continuous modifier that "suppresses" any other continuous modifier affecting ATK/DEF for THAT COMBAT. The modifiers will "turn back on" after the combat has passed.

Q: If I play Even The Odds on a character with -1/-1 counters does it remove them?

A: No, Even the odds does not remove -1/-1 counters, as it says, it only removes +1/+1 counters.

Q: Hello, a question about the Perfect Organism and Even The Odds. If I use the ability to strike with double of the attack, (**This Thing is Huge! It's...It's Big!** / **[Fearless](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_fearless)**) and my opponent plays Even The Odds, what happen?

A: This **Thing is Huge! It's... It's Big!** does not actually modify the ATK. It is modifying how hard it strikes during combat resolution. Normally when you strike, you strike an equal amount to your ATK. This power (and the Daredevil one) changes the rules of the game so that you are striking with double that amount, or triple with Amplify.

# [Evil Deadpool](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-005.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MFM-005, ^MFM-006

*Set: Deadpool & Friends* 
  
Made from Deadpool’s discarded body parts that fused back together into a new person, Evil Deadpool gains XP whenever you discard a character. This includes powering up as well as any effect that causes you to “discard” a card (whether you or your opponent controls the effect).

**Merc With an Evil Mouth**  
Evil Deadpool loves being Evil. That’s why he can grant Evil characters on your side the new keyword, Evil Lethal. Evil Lethal works just like regular Lethal except after you KO the supporting defender you laugh evilly. (If you’re unable to laugh evilly you’ll still resolve the effect as much as possible and KO the defender.)  

**It's Like You, But Eviler!**  
Evil Deadpool’s Level 2 super power puts Good characters into play but turns them Evil and adds the word “Evil” at the beginning of their name. Changing their name DOES affect the uniqueness rules. For example, it would allow you to have “Iron Man” and “Evil Iron Man” on your side at the same time. However, you would not be able to add “Evil” to regular Deadpool because then his name would be “Evil Deadpool” which is the same name as your main character. And Evil Deadpool hates Deadpool anyway.

^CardNumber: ^ALN-052

*Set: The Alien Battles*  

**Facehuggers and Capturing Characters**   
If you have [Ovomorphs](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/small/ALN-035.jpg) in your deck (the eggs that make Facehuggers), you’ll use the Facehugger Pile. 

* The Facehugger Pile includes three Facehugger token characters and one Extended Incubation card. These cards start the game out of play. (If more than one player is using Ovomorphs, they will each use their own Facehugger Pile.)   
* When an Ovomorph is ready to Hatch, reveal a random card from your Facehugger Pile.  
* If you reveal the Extended Incubation card, the Ovomorph doesn’t open yet. Shuffle the Extended Incubation card back into your Facehugger Pile.  
* If you reveal a Facehugger token character, KO its Ovomorph, put the Facehugger into your Back Row, and it captures an enemy supporting character. (It can capture a face-up or stunned supporting character.)  

“Capture” is a new game action that means:  

 - Remove the Captive card from the game, but keep any wound counters on it.  
 - Put the Captive card next to (or underneath) its Captor to make it clear who its Captor is.  
 - When the Captor leaves play, put its Captive back into play stunned in its owner’s back row.  
 - You may pay an ![](%%Alien%%)(Alien) at the start of your Build Phase. If you do, KO the Facehugger and put its captive into its owner’s KO pile. Then you may put an (Xenomorph) character from your hand into your back row. (This represents the new Xenomorph bursting out of the captive’s chest.)  
 - Note: Put the KO’d Facehugger token back into your Facehugger Pile.

Some characters have a **Bond** with another character. This allows them to be discarded from your hand to generate a Power Symbol for that other character’s Super Powers. You can do this for that character’s Main or Supporting Character. 

Example: You want to use the Falconer Supporting Character’s **Bait and Switch** Super Power, which costs ![](%%Skill%%) (Skill). You may discard a Falcon Drone from your hand to pay for the Super Power. If a character with Bond is used to generate a Power Symbol for a Super Power with Amplify, the Amplify text will apply

Falconer starts the game with a Falcon Drone from your deck on his side. The Falcon Drone still counts toward your 60 cards when you build your deck. 

His Level Up Power, **We’re the Game**, triggers whenever an enemy player reveals one or more cards.

**The Core Four** requires you to have at least one of the listed characters face up on your side. You can then give any character on your side (not just one of the core four) a combination of four total ATK/DEF. For example, you could give a character +0/+4, +1/+3, +2/+2, +3/+1, or +4/+0. **Note:** You can't use negative numbers here such as +5/-1.

>Fin Fang Foom cannot attack a row if any character in that row is an illegal target

For example, if [Xenomorph Ambusher](https://i.imgur.com/XHtrRFS.jpg) was in the back row, Fin Fang Foom cannot declare an attack on that row due to the Ambusher's "Camouflage" keyword.

^(Source: Official Clarification)

> If an effect would remove a defender from the attack when Fin Fang Foom is the attacker, that defender remains removed from the attack even if it did not change rows

This ruling was made to clarify how Fin Fang Foom would interact with cards such as [Dramatic Entrance](https://i.imgur.com/bit8aVS.jpg) or [Uncanny Defense](https://i.imgur.com/unboeQ6.png) that remove a defender from the combat, but may still result in the defender occupying the row that Foom is attacking.  The ruling is that the defender removed by one of these cards is no longer part of the combat.

>The [Massive](https://i.imgur.com/e0WOynY.png) keyword does not combine with special attack declarations such as attacking a [Machine](https://i.imgur.com/Fg27kSk.jpg) or attacking a Location.

Attacking a machine is a special type of attack declaration that can only be done if all conditions are met. (No face up characters in the same row as the machine and the attacker can otherwise legally make an attack on that row.)  This was compared to attacking a location with the keyword on [The Thing That Crawls By Night](https://i.imgur.com/U3yOlXN.jpg).  Attacking a row with Massive is Foom's normal attack mode and does not combine with these special attack declarations.  That said, if Foom attacks a row with a Machine in it, he will simply not strike the Machine.  Foom can choose to make a single target attack on the machine if the other conditions are met allowing him to do so.  This is the same as the power on [The Thing That Crawls By Night](https://i.imgur.com/U3yOlXN.jpg) where if an SC were to gain both powers at once, they could not attack multiple Locations in a player's row.  They would need to either attack the front or back row with Massive or attack a Location with the keyword "Nothing is Too Big For it to Attack!"

^(Source: Official Clarification)

Q: What if Fin Fang Foom is equipped with a Tranquilizer Gun and attacks a row. How does that work?

A: When FFF makes a ranged attack against a row with an equipped Tranquilizer Gun, Tranquilizer Gun's power will trigger once for each defending character that has a super power. Then on each resolution, you'll decide whether or not to stun that particular character with a super power.

^CardNumber: ^FAN-021

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Franklin is one of the most powerful beings in the multiverse. So powerful he has been able to, from a young age, create a **Pocket Universe**. Here's what happens when he does that:

* Move each Character other than Franklin to the side of the playing space. **They are now in a separate part of the game.**
    * A **Pocket Universe** has only front and back rows (no resource row).  
    * When the characters are moved to the **Pocket Universe** they stay in the same rows they were in in the original universe. They keep all their counters and their orientation (ready/exhausted; face up/face down).  
    * The **Pocket Universe** is still in the same overall game as the original universe. So cards don't "appear" or "leave play" when they move from the original universe to the **Pocket Universe** or vice versa.  
    * Cards in the **Pocket Universe** cannot attack or otherwise affect cards in the original universe and vice versa.  
    * The Uniqueness rules don't apply across the **Pocket Universe** and original universe. (For example, you could have a Human Torch in both Universes.)  
    * Note: Your hand, deck, KO pile, and out-of-game piles can be accessed in both the original universe and the **Pocket Universe** (more on this below).  
* Each player who has characters in a **Pocket Universe** will take a separate turn in that **Pocket Universe** after their normal turn (before the next player's normal turn, and including the turn Franklin creates the **Pocket Universe**).  
    * First take your normal turn. During this turn, ignore the **Pocket Universe**.  
    * After your turn is over, you then take a **Pocket Universe** turn. During this turn, ignore the original universe.  
    * The cards you play on a particular turn can only affect that turn's universe.  
* A **Pocket Universe** turn sequence is a little different than a normal turn, as follows:  
    * Start of turn  
        * Note that there is no Draw Phase.  
    * Recovery Phase  
    * Formation Step  
        * Note that there is no Build Phase because there are no Recruit Points or resource rows in the **Pocket Universe**.  
    * Main Phase  
        * This works just like a "Normal" Main Phase in regard to combats.  
        * You can play Plot Twists from our hand to affect a **Pocket Universe**.
        * You can discard Locations from your hand to generate a power symbol in the **Pocket Universe**. (Since the **Pocket Universe** has no resource row, there are no locations to turn face down to generate a power symbol.)  
        * You can discard characters from your hand to Power Up characters in a **Pocket Universe**.
        * When a character is KO'd in a **Pocket Universe**, they go to the normal KO pile. Similarly, if a character leaves play due to an effect, it works the same as if the character were still in the original universe. For example, if an effect returned the character to its owner's hand, it would go to that hand as normal.
    * End of turn
* If there is more than one **Pocket Universe** in the game, each player will take their normal turn first, then a **Pocket Universe** turn for each **Pocket Universe** they have characters in, starting with the first **Pocket Universe** created, then the second, etc.
    * Cards in one **Pocket Universe** cannot attack or otherwise affect cards in another **Pocket Universe**.
* When Franklin leaves play, the characters from each **Pocket Universe** he created pop back into the original universe part of the game, in the same rows and with the same orientation they were in their **Pocket Universe**.
    * If this leads to more than one character with the same name on your side, KO all except one (your choice).
