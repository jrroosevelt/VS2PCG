# Card clarifications and FAQs

The following card-specific information is a culmination of clarifications, rule changes, and FAQs from various sources. After each item (or series of items), there's a "Source" indicator that specifies whether the item came from:
* Rule inserts from the set
* An official FAQ doc published by Upper Deck Entertainment (UDE FAQ)
* An official rule change, clarification, or errata
* A community source, such as Facebook or Discord. (Some of these have been officially approved by UDE and, if so, are noted in the source citation). 

**Note**: There have been some minor editorial liberties taken (not all are exact quotations from the main source). These changes are mainly cosmetic or made to help understand context outside of the rule-sheet and do not fundamentally change the intent of the original text.

# [Abduction](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-037.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^XFB-037

*Set: The X-Files Battles*

The abducted character will re-enter the game with wound counters on it equal to its printed health minus one. So if it has 3 printed health, it will re-enter the game with two wounds. **Note:** This won't trigger any powers that look for "when a character gets wounded**.

# [Abomination](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu1-033.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MCU1-033

*Set: MCU Battles*
  
Abomination’s **Give Me a Real Fight!** Power forces a player’s first attack to include a specific character and the defender must be Abomination. However if either that character can’t attack or Abomination can’t be attacked, the effect does nothing. Also, the player can choose not to attack at all on their turn.

# [Adam Warlock](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-001.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: ^GAL-001, ^GAL-002

*Set: Galactic Guardians* 
 
At [Level 1](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-001.jpg), if Adam Warlock gets KO'd by getting stunned, **Prepare for Rebirth** will cause him to gain an XP and become [Level 2](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-002.jpg) while in the stunned position. (If a power like Hex prevents him from leveling up, he'll remain at Level 1 but still heal his wounds.)

# [Agamotto](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MYS-014.jpg) 
^CardNumber: ^MYS-014

*Set: Mystic Arts*

Scenario: My opponent takes over one of my SCs with Serpent Crown. I then play Agamotto which removes powers not printed on the card. I'm confident that the opponent isn't returned to me outright (because that trigger has already resolved).

> After the recent rules revision, the powers on Serpent Crown no longer "count" as being on the equipped character. As such, Agamotto will not remove those powers (since he only affects characters, not equipment.)

> In other words, playing Agamotto will not return the stolen character to you.

But what about the second part of the  **Under Set's Control** power (When this is unequipped...)? Is that considered a Trigger or a Delayed Trigger Modifier? If it's a Trigger, I assume that this character now remains on my opponent's side, even if the Crown is removed. If it's a Delayed Trigger Modifier, I assume that the character remains on my opponent's side indefinitely if the Crown is removed while Agamotto is face up. (Hope that all makes sense.)

> Some technical answers are incoming (but it sounds like that's what you're looking for).

> It's a Delayed Trigger Modifier. Under Set's Control works as follows:

> The first sentence is a triggered effect with two modifiers -- the first is a one-shot modifier that moves the character from one side to another. The second sets up a delayed triggered modifier that waits for the Crown to become unequipped.

Do you have any tips on telling one apart from the other, as they both can contain the "When" clause?

> The visual cue is a paragraph break between the two modifiers. If there's a separation, they are two separate effects each with its own modifier(s). If there's no separation, it's a single effect with multiple modifiers.

> **Example 1: Two separate triggered effects, each with a one-shot modifier.**

> **_Cool Draw + Discard Power_**

> **When this character appears, draw a card.**

> **When this character gets KO'd, discard a card.**

> Player A plays the above character and draws a card.

> Player B plays plays Nullifier and names "_Cool Draw + Discard Power_."

> The character gets KO'd. Since the power is gone, its second sentence won't trigger and the player doesn't have to discard a card.

> **Example 2: One triggered effect which generates one one-shot modifier and one delayed trigger modifier.**

> **_Cool Draw + Discard Power_**

> **When this character appears, draw a card. When this character gets KO'd, discard a card.**

> Player A plays the above character. The one shot-modifier causes the player to draw a card. The delayed trigger modifier is set up and waits for the character to get KO'd. It exists independently from the effect that generated it.

> Player B plays Nullifier and names "_Cool Draw + Discard Power_."

> The character gets KO'd. The power is gone, but the delayed trigger modifier exists separately from the power, so it will still trigger and the player will discard a card.

Q: If my supporting character has a a Vitality counter and gets stunned while my opponent has Agamotto in play, does that character get wounded or do you just remove the Vitality counter?

A: Although the vitality counter does not actually add to the character's health total, it still cancels out a wound.

***The All Seeing*** power makes it so that any modifiers increasing the ATK/ DEF or Health of an enemy character do not apply to the character. This does not remove the sources of those modifiers like in the case of the Ancient One providing +1 health or the quinjet providing +3/+3. Although the Vitality counters are no longer giving the character in question + health, they still exist just like in the *Gorgon* example below [See FB Post]. So the rules surrounding the removal and application of counters are still affecting the game.

# [Agatha Harkness](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-013.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FAN-013

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

If Agatha appearing on your side KOs an Agatha that was already on your side (due to uniqueness), **Ancient Sorceress** will count the Agatha that was KO'd.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# Agent Venom (Level 2 MC)
^CardNumber: ^LET-006

*Set: Lethal Protector*  

This character has a **"Level Down"** power. A **Level Down** Power works just like a **Level Up** Power, except instead of gaining XP which advances it to a higher level, it gains XP which regresses it back to a lower level. When a character gains **Level Down** XP, put an XP counter on its Main Character card that is one level lower than its current level.

**Note** Agent Venom has 6 Health, representing his increased durability and life force of the Symbiote. But Flash by himself only has 5 Health, so if Agent Venom has 5 wounds and Levels Down, Flash will get KO'd.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# Agony and Riot
^CardNumber: ^LET-009, ^LET-007

*Set: Lethal Protector*  

These characters have "stun" powers: **Assassin** and **Warrior** respectively. If they trigger their power, but area lso stunned at the same time, they **will** get their +1/+1 counters.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Ahab](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FUT-023.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FUT-023

*Set: Futures Past*

You start the game with a private out-of-game Hound pile. The pile must contain exactly 4 different supporting characters of your choice with (Brotherhood), (Resistance), and/or (X-men) who do not share any names and do not have any copies in your deck. For the game, Hounds lose their printed team affiliations, and gain the (Sentinel) affiliation.

^(Source: Rule Insert)

Q: Do I have to reveal the Hound when I recruit it?

A: Yes. When Ahab appears, choose a Hound, reveal it to all other players, and then put it into your hand.

# [Ajax](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-012.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MFM-012

*Set: Deadpool & Friends*  

Ajax's **Pain Tolerance** power says he can only be KO'd by fatal wounds at the end of a turn. A character has fatal wounds if it has at least as many wounds as its health. So Ajax can have any amount of wounds but won't actually get KO'd until the end of a turn.

^(Source: Rule insert)

---

Q: Does his power imply that fatal wounds at the end of the turn is the ONLY way to KO him? For example, if a character power or card effect would KO him directly (such as Simon Trask's Human Sentinel One), is he still KO'd?

A: Fatal wounds can’t KO him until end of turn. Other effects (like Simon Trask) can KO him normally.

# [Alcatraz](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HAM-019.jpg)

*Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.*  

When the character in “prison” turns face up, the player who used Alcatraz decides which row on its original side it goes back to.

# Alex Krycek
## [Alex Krycek (MC)](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-022.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^XFB-022, ^XFB-023

*Set: The X-Files Battles*

**Fight or Die** can choose any random Main Character, even ones not in the combat. WE suggest rolling a die to determine which character gets stunned. If Kryceck gets stunned this way, he will get removed from combat. If a stunned Main Character is chosen, nothing happens. If a hidden Main Character is chosen, stun it.

^(Source: Rule Insert)

## [Alex Krycek (SC)](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-033.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^XFB-033

*Set: The X-Files Battles*

**We All Have a Life in Our Hands** says to choose a unique character. This counts any character that doesn't have **Swarm**. To secretly choose a character we suggest jotting its name down on a piece of paper. **Note:** If the character you chose gets KO'd but then later another character with the same name is in play, the new character does NOT count for **We All Have a Life in Our Hands**.

# [Alicia Masters](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-009.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FAN-009

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Here's an example of how her **Neo-Realistic Sculptor** works. The Thing is on your side, who has 10/6 ATK/DEF. While Alicia is also on your side, his ATK/DEF become  10/10.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Alien Symbiote](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SPF-021.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^SPF-021

*Set: Spider Friends*

>If a character that is equipped with the Alien Symbiote gains an equipment card, put the Alien Symbiote in the KO pile.

The text on Alien Symbiote says that it cannot be KO'd but the One-Equip rule in the rule book will override this text if the character is equipped with another equipment card.  Cards must explicitly (not implicitly) override game mechanics and this was ruled that it was not intended to override the one-equipment rule.

# [Alter Ego](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MCU7-019.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MCU7-019

*Set: Friendly Neighborhood*  

"Make up a new name" means you must rename a character card with something that is not already the name of a character in the Vs System 2PCG. Some examples of made-up names are "Night Monkey", "Dr. Baby", and "The Fudge".

Removing a character's current names (which also makes the character lose all its **AKA**s) and replacing it lets you get around the uniqueness rules. For example, if you change Spider-Man's name to Night Monkey, you can now play or have another copy of that Spider-Man cad in play at the same time since they have different names. (On the other hand, you can no longer discard a Spider-Man character to power up Night Monkey.)

If a character references itself in its text box, those references will also use its new name.

Q: So, I know that Alter Ego can't give a character a name that already exists. However, can I use part of a name that already exists? For example, could I rename a character as "Ultra Captain America" and thereby be able to use The Greatest Symbol plot twist with that character?

A: Alter Ego can be used to create a new name for a character that does not already exist within the game.

This name can include the words "Captain America". That would then allow The Greatest Symbol to reduce the cost of that character's super power. 

(**Editor's Note:** The Greatest Symbol only requires a character with "Captain America" in its name to play the card - it doesn't have to be used for that character specifically. This ruling would also allow you to play the Captain America's Shield equipment on a character you renamed as mentioned above.)

# [Angel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/RES-001.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: ^RES-001, ^RES-002

*Set: Resistance*  

When Angel levels up, he transforms into [Archangel](#wiki_archangel). When this happens, he keeps his orientation (ready/exhausted, face-up/face-down), all of his counters, and any effects on him. Also note Archangel doesn’t have a Level 1 version. The only way to become him normally is to start the game with (Resistance) Level 1 Angel as your Main Character.

# [Angel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-001.jpg)/[Angelus](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-028.jpg) (MC) 
^CardNumber: ^TBB-001, ^TBB-028

*Set: The Buffy Battles*  

Level 1 Angel and Angelus can transform between each other. However, when you build a deck you must choose either Angel or Angelus to be your starting Main Character. (You must lock in your decision at the time you build your deck, not after you see what Main Character your opponent is using.) When Angel transforms into Angelus or vice versa, he keeps his orientation (ready/exhausted, face up/face down), all of his counters (including XP), and any effects on him.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Angela](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-015.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^GAL-015

*Set: Galactic Guardians*  

**An Angel From the Heavens** makes it difficult for Angela to be solo attacked. An attacker must have ![](%%Flight%%) or ![](%%Range%%) (or both) to solo attack her. 

When Angela opens a **Bridge to Heven**, you must put each revealed character onto your side. This may cause some characters to be KO'd due to the uniqueness rules.

# Angry Beasts (Terrain)
^CardNumber: ^CV4-027

*Set: Crossover Vol. 4* 

Besides being angry, the wolves are very smart, and good listeners. If there is a tie for the lowest DEF in his row, the player who placed the wolves chooses who to put the -1/-1 counters on.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Annihilus](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FRI-001.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FRI-001, ^FRI-002

*Set: The Frightful*

**Lord of the Negative Zone** allows you to include up to two Negative Zone Locations in your deck. (If Mister Fantastic is in your deck your Invention pile will also include its usual two Negative Zones.)

**The Living Death That Walks** grants 1 XP for each of the listed actions. So if Annihilus attacks, strikes, and stuns a defending character, but somehow doesn't wound or KO it, he will gain 3 XP.

When Annihilus levels up, you'll shuffle his Level 1 card into your deck. While it's in your hand you may reveal it for his **Continuous Rebirth** power. (You can also discard it to Power Up Annihilus. Put the discarded card into your Level Up zone, which is where his Level 2 card started the game.

# Arnim Zola
## [Arnim Zola](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-001.jpg) (MC-Illustrated)
^CardNumber: ^CV1-001, ^CV1-002

*Set: Crossover* 
 
**ESP Box** takes effect once the game starts and lasts the whole game (even while Arnim Zola is stunned, after he levels up, and even after he is KO’d). You can play any Equipment as a Supporting Character, regardless of whether you have a character with a matching team affiliation. When you play one as a Supporting Character, it’s no longer an Equipment. If it has a power that references “Equipped Character,” it is its own equipped character. When the card leaves play it will go back to being an Equipment. You may still play an Equipment normally and equip it to one of your characters (including on an Equipment that you played as a Supporting Character). 

When Arnim Zola enters **A New Robot Body**, your new Equipment-turned-Main Character will have ATK/DEF equal to its cost, 1 (Health), Swarm, and it will count as its own “Equipped Character,” just like with ESP Box. When that body gets KO’d, it can use this power again to jump into another robot body, and so on. Note: if you want to use a Wild Special Location to pay for this power, it must match the team affiliation of the Main Character using this power.

Then if exactly one face-up enemy character has more ATK than each other face-up enemy character, go to Part 2 of the Super Power and stun that character. Otherwise go to Part 3 and put two -1/-1 counters on each enemy character. If everything now makes sense, goto 2 above. If not, goto 3 above.

The copy has all the printed characteristics (name, team, cost, ATK/DEF, Health, powers) of that character but nothing else. It appears face up and ready and does not appear with any counters or status effects (like **Burn**). Uniqueness does apply to the token.

Q: Does **Hex** prevent a **Hypnotized** character from turning back into Level 2 at the start of my next turn?

This pile is Variable (you choose the Domains) and Private (only you can look at it during the game). If the game is already in a Battleworld Domain when he uses this power, that one goes to its discard pile.

The second pile, his Power pile, from his **Omnipotent** power, will contain any 5 different Supporting Characters. These characters can be any Vs.

# [Blackbird](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/DAR-017.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^DAR-017

*Set: Into the Darkness*

The Blackbird introduces a new kind of equipment to the game - Vehicles! When you play a Vehicle, equip it to one character like normal. But whenever you rearrange your Formation (including on the turn you played the Vehicle), you may have characters on your side get on or off the Vehicle. Choose any number up to the Vehicle's Passenger Limit (found next to "Vehicle" on its type line), put them next to each other in the same row, and equip the Vehicle to all of them. Here are more details:

- All passengers must legally be able to have the Vehicle equipped.
- If any already had an equipment, KO that equipment (because a character can only have one equipment at a time). 
	- If an equipment gets equipped to a passenger, it stops being equipped to the Vehicle, but the Vehicle is not KO'd as long as it has any other passengers.
- When you rearrange your Formation, you CAN remove passengers from the Vehicle. (They stop having it equipped to them.)
- When you're done rearranging, there must be at least one passenger.
- Put the Vehicle card close to each of its passengers and announce who is "on board."

**While a Vehicle has only one passenger, it works just like any other equipment.** If its passenger gets turned face down or leaves play, the Vehicle will get KO'd. If an effect moves the passenger to a different row, the Vehicle will move with them.

**While a Vehicle has more than one passenger, it works a little differently.** If a passenger gets turned face down or leaves play, it becomes unequipped from the Vehicle, but the Vehicle remains equipped to the other passenger(s). If all passengers do get turned face down or leave play at the same time, they all become unequipped from the Vehicle and the Vehicle gets KO'd. 

If an effect moves all passengers to a different row, the Vehicle goes with them. If an effect causes one or more passengers to be in one row and the others to be in a different row, the controller of the Vehicle chooses which group of passengers stays equipped to the Vehicle.

The X-Jet has up to four effects depending on how many passengers it has. For example, while there are exactly three face-up passengers, they will each have ![](%%Flight%%) (Flight) , +1/+1 and **Dodge**. If one passenger becomes unequipped, then the other two will now have ![](%%Flight%%) (Flight) and +1/+1.

^CardNumber: ^MMU-037, ^MMU-038

*Set: Monsters Unleashed!*  

Black Bolt’s Super Powers use the Amplify ability. When you use a Super Power, if you discard a Location (instead of turning it face-down in your resource row), you get the Amplify text. Previous Amplify Super Powers grant an effect to begin with but a larger effect if you Amplify it. Black Bolt’s powers only grant an effect if you Amplify them.

Q: If I use Black Bolt's **Sonic Whisper** and Black Bolt is Lethal (by playing "A Killer Voice" for example), will the opponent be KO'd?

A: If you are attacking, yes. Lethal only activates when attacking and when you cause a wound. Because **Sonic Whisper** is a combat ability, and stunning causes a wound, the opponent will be KO'd (barring any other effects that prevent the wound, etc.).

Q: If Satana is in play and Black Cat attacks a defender and uses **Cross their Path** to Daze that character, is it KO'd by Lethal?

A: Daze counts as stunning, but Lethal was changed to work when a wounding a defending supporting character. Since Daze does not wound, lethal is not applied.

*Set: Spider-Friends*  

**Personal Loyalty**  
Black Cat has often wavered between being a hero and a villain. In the game she doesn’t have a team affiliation and is neither Good nor Evil… until she’s on a side (she is neither Good nor Evil while she is in your hand, deck, or KO pile). Then if Spider-Man is your main character, he has a good influence on her and she’ll ferociously fight alongside her partner. But if he’s not your main character, she’ll go back to slinking around as a criminal.

If Blob strikes a character and his **Boing!** power causes that character to strike itself, you add Blob’s ATK to that character’s own ATK to see if it’s enough to stun it. 

**Immovable Object**  
If Blob moves for any reason (including during your Formation Step or because another effect moves him), he will be prevented from gaining an XP. At the end of Blob’s first turn of the game, he will gain an XP if he didn’t move that turn.

And his **Bounced Off His Belly** power represents projectiles getting bounced back at any ranged attackers. Note: In the event that Blob somehow had ![](%%Range%%) he would not strike back using his own ATK because Bounced Off His Belly’s strike back would override his normal strike back.

This plot twist really lets you get in the game. When you put a “Me” token onto your side, you get to choose a team affiliation and your age will determine your ATK and DEF. You’ll have Leader because you’re still in charge of your team, but don’t worry – if you get KO’d you don’t lose the game because you’re also still a player. We figure you have more questions about all this, so let’s dive in. 

* **How do you prove your age?** If you’re at a tournament you’ll need an ID with a birthday. If you don’t have one, we’ll just pretend you’re 11.  

* **Does this card have different power levels for different players depending on their age?** Yes.  

* **Isn’t that ageist?** Great question. Think about it this way: Yes.  

* **What happens if I’m 29 and tomorrow’s my birthday, but then it turns to midnight in the middle of the game?** You’ll become a 3/0 and get stunned.

Q: What happens if I use his power but the combat gets canceled?

Q: What happens if he’s team attacking and I use his power, but then he gets stunned before the combat resolves?

A: His power will still trigger and stun the defender even though Cable himself got stunned before the combat resolved. This is because once an effect resolves and creates a modifier, it is independent from the source that created it.

Q: I know that a face-down character can't have or gain -1 counters, but can it be the TARGET of a power that would grant -1/-1 counters? Specifically with Cloak MC, for instance, if all enemies are face-down, can his power still target one of those face-down characters? (But of course it wouldn't actually get added to them.)

A: Cloak does not specify face up so a face down character is a legal target for the ability.  This will result in no counters being placed unless Nightmare supporting character is face up and in play.

*Set: Deadpool & Friends*

Q: If I remove Copycat to Singularity's **Pocket Dimension** with two other characters, when all 3 return does Copycat get all the powers of the other two supporting characters she returned with?

A: If a modifier's duration would expire before it is created, then it is never created. Basically if two supporting characters appeared at the same time, they would both cause her to trigger, but also both cause the other to expire since they appeared simultaneously.

> If multiple characters "appear" at once, Copycat is unable to copy any of them.

With the reveal of Copycat, the question arose on her interaction with [Singularity](https://i.imgur.com/3vlwcdR.jpg).  Specifically, if multiple characters (other than Copycat) appear at once, which SC's powers, if any, does Copycat inherit?  The ruling is that if multiple triggers occur simultaneously for Copycat, she will not gain any powers.  The reasoning is that she only gains powers "until another supporting character appears on your side."  This means that when multiple characters appear at once, the duration of her effect has already expired by the time it resolves.  From head judge: "if a modifier’s duration would cause it to expire before it is created, then the modifier is never created."  Ultimately, Copycat needs only a single character to appear in order to resolve as intended.

Q: Question that came up about how Copy Cat interacts with Mary Walker.

Take this scenario: 

1. You recruit Copy Cat. 
2. You recruit Mary Walker with Composite Personality.
3. Now Copy Cat has Composite Personality.

The question is, does CC even do anything? Does it now read:

> Copy Cat has all of the powers of cards named “Copy Cat” in your KO pile”

OR

> Copy Cat has all of the powers of cards named “Mary Walker” in your KO pile

I say it’s the latter, because the “Mary” is the self referential part. The “Mary Walker” is the condition it is pointing to. But I’m not confident in that.

A:The end result is it gives Copycat the following: 

> Copy Cat has all of the powers of cards named Mary Walker in your KO pile.

(In other words, as you mentioned the phrase “cards named Mary Walker” is not self-referential.)

*Set: Space & Time*  

**Glaive Mastery** prevents an enemy character from gaining +1/+1 counters or an increase in ATK or DEF. For example, if an effect would give an enemy combatant +2/+0 and **Lethal**, and Corvus uses **Glaive Mastery**, that character would only gain **Lethal**. If an effect adds ATK but subtracts DEF (or adds DEF but subtracts ATK), Glaive Master will prevent the gain but not the loss.

# C.O.S

*Set: The X-Files Bttles*

Q: If I target a location with C.O.S., can enemy characters still use wild locations in their resource row to pay for their powers if that wild has the same symbol of the location I chose?

A: C.O.S.'s power says “Enemy characters can’t use locations in their resource row with that type to pay for super powers.” This specifically is talking about basic locations, so the enemy character CAN use wild locations in their resource row to pay for their powers. "Type" is referring to the type of symbol produced (Might, Energy, Humanity, etc.). However, keep in mind this is only inhibiting the resource row and players can still discard from hand to pay for super powers.

Hydra has four different Cosmic Cubes under their control. However, each one has a different Super Power using a different Power Symbol.

Q: If I play a red Cosmic Cube and call "Sentinel," for example, would it remove both Alpha Combat Units and Executive Types? Or what if I called "Captain America"? Would it remove Nomad or Supreme Leader? 

A: The Cosmic Cubes mention that you can choose a card and then "... remove any number of cards with that name... " (from where depends on the specific Cube). So, the "name" in this case would include:

- Cards with the title that matches the card you chose.
- Cards with **AKA** that matches the name of the card you chose.
- **BUT NOT** cards with a mantle that sounds like the name of the card you chose.

Sounds confusing? It kind of is. [Check out this infographic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11W764QPzEByqs-LJoICGQuArPRwur_A_/view?usp=sharing) for a visual example of how this does or doesn't apply.

Q: If my opponent has H.A.M.M.E.R. Cloak on his side and I play Dagger, is she KO'd by him before she can convert the -1 counters to +1?

A: She is not KO'd. She would get the +1 counters. Here are the steps when a character is recruited:

1. Announce the name of the character.
2. The character moves from whatever zone that it is in to the Resolving Zone. At this point it is considered “recruited”.
3. If any power would trigger off a character being recruited, resolve that effect, then continue. 
4. The character moves from the Resolving Zone to the Play Zone. 
5. Any powers are now active. 
6. Process any “appears with” text. 
7. At this point the character has now appeared.

So, as of step 5, Dagger's powers are active.

Cloak's power doesn't technically trigger until right after step 7.

**Radar Sense**  
Daredevil, Rhino, and Juggernaut have effects that allow an enemy *character* to spend a power symbol to do something. These cards have errata to explain that it is a character (not the player) paying for these abilities. So, in theory they could use a "wild" location to pay for it (if they have an appropriate face-up character for that wild's affiliation).

**Protector of Hell's Kitchen**

Q: If I attack Daredevil with Mary Walker (Typhoid Mary) and I put a -1/-1 counter on Daredevil and one on the only character he's protecting which happens to have 1 defense (like Black Widow), KO'ing her, does Daredevil gets an XP?

A: The turn player decides the order per the rule book under "Timing." Daredevil's level up power has an intervening "if" clause, which means the condition must be true when it triggers AND when it resolves. So if the turn player decides to resolve Mary Walker's power before Daredevil's power, Daredevil will not get an XP because he won't be protecting anyone once his level up power resolves. On the other hand, if the turn player decides to resolve Daredevil's power before Mary's then Daredevil will gain an XP.

*Set: Utopia Battles*

Q: Dark Beast SC2. "Pay 2 less to play evil equipment." Outside of Darkhold, how does one define "evil" equipment?

A: [Good or Evil](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/good_or_evil) affiliations are typically based on the [Team Affiliation](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_team_affiliation) of the card. 

For example: Power Loader would be Good because it has The Company team affiliation, but Omega Machine would be Evil because it is H.A.M.M.E.R. affiliated.

However, for this specific question it should be noted that Darkhold is neutral. It does require you to have a Marvel character, but Marvel isn't a Team Affiliation and doesn't make the card Good or Evil. So Darkhold - even though it can only be equipped to an Evil character -  is not Evil itself (and would *not* benefit from Dark Beast's power).

**Deconstruct the Universe**  
When Deconstructs the Universe, an entire concept of the game gets removed for the rest of the game (even if she leaves play). If, as a result of this, the wording of a card’s power is unclear, the part that is unclear does nothing. Here’s how removing each concept works: 

* **+1/+1 and -1/-1 counters:** Remove all of those counters from the game. Remove the phrases “+1/+1 counter” and “-1/-1 counter” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause these counters to enter the game in any way 
 
* **Equipment**: Remove all Equipment cards everywhere from the game. This includes all sides, decks, hands, KO piles, and Equipment that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Equipment cards but don’t currently count as Equipment (such as a face-down resource or an Equipment that has become a character via Arnim Zola’s   
**ESP Box** ). Remove the term “Equipment” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Equipment to enter the game in any way.  

* **Keyword text:** Removing this concept doesn’t affect ![](%%Flight%%) and ![](%%Range%%). Remove all Keyword text from the game, including powers that “can’t be turned off”. Remove the term “Keyword” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Keyword text to enter the game in any way.  
 
* **Levels:** All Main Characters everywhere become Level 1 if possible. Remove all remaining Level 2 and higher Main Characters from the game. Remove all Level Up Powers and XP from the game, and the terms “Level” and “XP” from all card text. Ignore any effects that would cause XP or a Level 2 or higher Main Character to enter the game in any way.  

* **Plot Twists:** Remove all Plot Twist cards everywhere from the game. This includes all decks, hands, KO piles, and Plot Twists that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Plot Twist cards but are not currently Plot Twists (such as a face-down resource). Remove the term “Plot Twist” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause a Plot Twist to enter the game in any way.  

* **Super Powers:** Remove all Super Powers from the game. Remove the term “Super Power” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Super Powers to enter the game in any way.

Q: If a player calls keywords with ***Deconstruct the Universe***, are you able to play Spell plot twists without a spellcaster or without playing the power symbol?

A: Since ***[Symbol] Spell*** is a keyword, Dark Phoenix removes their existence. That section of text is removed from the card and Spells are treated as normal plot twists without an additional cost, you don’t even need Spellcasters as those keywords are removed also.

You can pretty much do whatever you want.  
> 
> I like designing so much, I wanted to do some while I was in the game too. My new main character can **nerf** stuff, **errata** stuff, and even **ban** stuff. Check it out:  

**I'm Taking Over From These Idiot Designers**  
  
* **Nerf:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks, and KO piles are 0/1 with 1 and nothing can ever, ever change that.  

* **Errata:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles lose and can’t gain powers (including ![](%%Flight%%) and ![](%%Range%%)). 
 
* **Ban:** Name a character and choose a number. Put all supporting characters with that name on enemy sides into their owner’s hands. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles have a cost equal to the chosen number and nothing can ever, ever change that. (Except banning it again. You know the old saying: “If you really, really hate a card, ban it twice.”) Any effects that would increase or decrease what an enemy player pays to recruit a banned card are ignored.  

Here are some quick tips:  

* If you steal a character with one of those effects the effect will stop because it’s not an enemy character anymore. Yay! However, if it goes back to an enemy side the effect will turn on again. Boo!  

* When you Ban a character, you can name any number you want. Even a million bazillion. Try it, it’s fun!

* If someone tries to tell you that this isn’t really how nerfing, errata-ing, and banning works, you just take your katana and do some "development” on them, if you know what I mean.

Q: What’s going on with his **Oh, there’s someone! Hi there!** power?

Q: What does “the player counts as a supporting character” mean?

A: It means that if Deadpool is attacking you, you can play Plot Twists that would help a supporting character to increase your stats or otherwise survive the combat.

Q: What if an effect puts a +1/+1 or -1/-1 counter on me while I’m defending against Deadpool?

A: It goes on you. If this puts you to 0 DEF, you’ll get stunned (and KO’d). If it makes your stats better, that could help you survive this attack and will stick around to help you if he attacks you again on a later turn.

Q: What if I get KO’d?

A: You’re out of the game, the same way as if your Main Character got KO’d. (You do not actually lose consciousness.)

Death is **Amortal** which means:

* She has no level (She is beyond such mortal trappings).  
* She starts with her card that has infinite health. (Her other card has 8 health, also known as sideways infinity.)  
* She can't be face down. If she would be turned face down, switch her with her other card instead and leave it face up. For example when she gets stunned, instead of turning her face down, switch her with her other card which will remain face up. She still suffers other effects from the stun such as losing the +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters, gaining a wound, and becoming exhausted.  
* If she would be hidden, instead switch her with her other card which will remain face up and place her in the ready position.  
* Amortal can't be turned off.
 
Since Death doesn't turn face down, she can be stunned multiple times in a single turn. However, if she takes fatal wounds she's not really defeated. She's just temporarily lost interest in this mortal battle. (The player who was using her is defeated, though.) 

**Note:** While death is technically two cards, you could slip her into a single clear card sleeve with her cards back to back. Then when she would turn face down, you can just flip her to her other "side."  

**Mistress of the Infinity Well** allows each player to draw an extra card each time you draw cards. For example, when you draw your usual two cards during your Draw Phase, you'll draw an extra one. And if you have a **Genius** in play that lets you draw a card, you'll draw an extra one then, too.

> If a character gets stunned by an effect during combat but before the combat resolves, it is removed from the combat.

So at the point it is dazed, it is removed from the combat and Devil-Slayer isn't able to "follow-through" with the attack.

Once the deck is shuffled, where the card is in the deck is public information, so we also suggest you turn it 90 degrees so it's sticking out of your deck.

# [Doombot](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-045.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FAN-045

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*   

Q: Does “an exact replica” trigger once for each Doombot in play. I.e. I have MC Doom and two Doombots on my side. Doom is stunned and would be wounded. An exact replica triggers on one of my two Doombots and the MC Doom is the random card chosen. Before he would be wounded, does the second Doombots keyword trigger and I pick another card at random to have the chance to potentially prevent the wound a second time?

A: First thing to know is it, is NOT a trigger. A trigger will ALWAYS start with the words, "When, Whenever, At". This is a replacement power. In short, you can try once per Doombot.

If there are multiple Doombots, that means there are multiple modifiers trying to replace the same event. If there are multiple replacement modifiers trying to apply to the same event, you choose one to apply.

If after you processed the replacement modifier, the event no longer happens, then the rest of the replacement modifiers do nothing. If the event still would happen, then you apply another replacement modifier. You keep doing this until the event no longer happens, or you have ran out of replacement modifiers.

In the case of Doombot, the event in question is Doctor Doom being wounded. As long as he is still being wounded, you may continue to try to apply replacement modifiers.

# Doop
^CardNumber: ^HOX-054

*Set: House of X*   

While Doop is **Watching the Game** his card should be facing out from your hand so your opponents can see him (and so he can see the game!). He still counts as being in your hand (and not on your side). For example, you could recruit him normally (putting him onto your side), effects could make you discard him, or you could discard him to power up another Doop that's in play.

While Doop is wathing the game, he can't attack. However he can **be** attacked if:

 - All characters in your front and back row are face down and
 - The attacker(s) has at least 7 ATK.

When he gets attacked, discard him. (This happens right away. For example, players won't be able to play Plot Twists and the attacker(s) doesn't "strike" Doop.)

You may only have one Doop **Watching the Game** at a time. If another Doop starts watching the game from your hand, turn the first one back around so it's in your hand normally.

**Resident of Marginalia** causes a player to skip one of their next phases. In this case, treat that phase as if it doesn't exist on that turn. **Note:** If a player skips their Draw Phase, any "start of turn" effects will occur at the start of their Recovery Phase. Similarly, if a player skips their Main Phase, any "end of turn" effects will occur at the end of their Build Phase.

*Set: A-Force* 

Q: Do "Appears" powers work when character are brought into play with Dramatic Entrance? I'm not sure because it says, "put into play."

A: It does not matter how a character enters play. If it goes from not being in play, to being in play, it has "appeared" whether that is from recruiting, or some other effect putting it into play.

Q: How does Dramatic Entrance work if I bring a Loki 7 drop SC into play with it? Does Loki draw me a card if it was the first PT I played that turn? Or since it wasn't in play, it doesn't grant me the benefit? If it doesn't, then does the next PT I play that turn trigger Loki's Schemer power?

A: If you bring in Loki SC with Dramatic Entrance, Schemer will not trigger. At the time you PLAYED the plot twist, Loki was not in play. Once he is in play, he does not look back in time and see that you played a plot twist. Also if you play another plot twist, Schemer will still not trigger because it is not your first plot twist played this turn.

Q: If you dramatic entrance a Wasp or Ant-man can you just Shrink the combat?

Q: If I use Dramatic Entrance to put Adam Warlock into play as the new Defender, what happens since he comes into play stunned due to his **Evolutionary Cocoon**?

A: The original defender is still removed from combat, but since Adam enters play stunned, he can not become the defender, so he will enter play and he will be unable to become the defender. Since there is no defender, the combat will end, at which point, the delayed trigger will trigger and KO Adam Warlock.

Since this is a "transformation", the Lizard will keep any counters and effects that Dr. Connors had (including a wound counter since he was just stunned).

You can include up to the usual four copies of Lizard in your deck as well as bring up to four copies for your Lizard pile (one for each copy of Dr. Cur Connors in your deck). If you don't have any Lizards in your Lizard pile, **The Monster Within** won't do anything.

Q: Hello, a question about the Perfect Organism and Even The Odds. If I use the ability to strike with double of the attack, (**This Thing is Huge! It's...It's Big!** / **[Fearless](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_fearless)**) and my opponent plays Even The Odds, what happen?

A: This **Thing is Huge! It's... It's Big!** does not actually modify the ATK. It is modifying how hard it strikes during combat resolution. Normally when you strike, you strike an equal amount to your ATK. This power (and the Daredevil one) changes the rules of the game so that you are striking with double that amount, or triple with Amplify.

Made from Deadpool’s discarded body parts that fused back together into a new person, Evil Deadpool gains XP whenever you discard a character. This includes powering up as well as any effect that causes you to “discard” a card (whether you or your opponent controls the effect).

**Merc With an Evil Mouth**  
Evil Deadpool loves being Evil. That’s why he can grant Evil characters on your side the new keyword, Evil Lethal. Evil Lethal works just like regular Lethal except after you KO the supporting defender you laugh evilly. (If you’re unable to laugh evilly you’ll still resolve the effect as much as possible and KO the defender.)  

**It's Like You, But Eviler!**  
Evil Deadpool’s Level 2 super power puts Good characters into play but turns them Evil and adds the word “Evil” at the beginning of their name. Changing their name DOES affect the uniqueness rules. For example, it would allow you to have “Iron Man” and “Evil Iron Man” on your side at the same time. However, you would not be able to add “Evil” to regular Deadpool because then his name would be “Evil Deadpool” which is the same name as your main character. And Evil Deadpool hates Deadpool anyway.

“Capture” is a new game action that means:  

 - Remove the Captive card from the game, but keep any wound counters on it.  
 - Put the Captive card next to (or underneath) its Captor to make it clear who its Captor is.  
 - When the Captor leaves play, put its Captive back into play stunned in its owner’s back row.

>The [Massive](https://i.imgur.com/e0WOynY.png) keyword does not combine with special attack declarations such as attacking a [Machine](https://i.imgur.com/Fg27kSk.jpg) or attacking a Location.

Attacking a machine is a special type of attack declaration that can only be done if all conditions are met. (No face up characters in the same row as the machine and the attacker can otherwise legally make an attack on that row.)  This was compared to attacking a location with the keyword on [The Thing That Crawls By Night](https://i.imgur.com/U3yOlXN.jpg).  Attacking a row with Massive is Foom's normal attack mode and does not combine with these special attack declarations.  That said, if Foom attacks a row with a Machine in it, he will simply not strike the Machine.  Foom can choose to make a single target attack on the machine if the other conditions are met allowing him to do so.  This is the same as the power on [The Thing That Crawls By Night](https://i.imgur.com/U3yOlXN.jpg) where if an SC were to gain both powers at once, they could not attack multiple Locations in a player's row.  They would need to either attack the front or back row with Massive or attack a Location with the keyword "Nothing is Too Big For it to Attack!"

Q: What if Fin Fang Foom is equipped with a Tranquilizer Gun and attacks a row. How does that work?

A: When FFF makes a ranged attack against a row with an equipped Tranquilizer Gun, Tranquilizer Gun's power will trigger once for each defending character that has a super power. Then on each resolution, you'll decide whether or not to stun that particular character with a super power.

^CardNumber: ^TBB-034, ^TBB-035

*Set: The Buffy Battles*  

If two or more players are playing as The First Evil, they will need to randomly determine who chooses which one takes the first turn.

Q: In a mirror match does each, "The First Evil" get XP from ***From Beneath You, It Devours***, or can you only get XP from your own activations of the power?

A: When a card references its own name without stating “character(s) named”, it is always referring to itself and only this instance of itself (for situations where multiple cards with the same name are in play). Because ***From Beneath You, It Devours*** refers to itself and says "…for each character put into the KO pile this way." it is specifically looking at its own activation of this power. You will not gain XP from the opponent’s trigger of ***From Beneath You, It Devours***.

If the Flukeman is on your side and he **Infects** a character, this means at the end of each of your turns, put a -1/-1 counter on that character. The character will remain **Infected** until it leaves play. (Flukeman leaving play will NOT end the Infection). A character can be **Infected** more than once, and will receive a -1/-1 counter for each instance of the infection.

Note that Forge's card number starts with "NEW" instead of "DAR". This is so that he works with cards that refer to "New Mutants" from the New Mutants Issue, like the Professor X main character.

^CardNumber: ^XFB-0003, ^XFB-004

*Set: The X-Files Battles*

**Spooky** and **I Want to Believe** look for ![](%%Alien%%) (Alien) Super Powers. This includes any Super Power that costs at least one ![](%%Alien%%) (Alien) symbol to use. With **Spooky,** if you choose an Evil enemy character with an ![](%%Alien%%) (Alien) Super Power, you can either daze it, stun it, or KO it (although you only get to pick one of the three options). The same is true for **I Want to Believe**: if an Evil enemy character with an ![](%%Alien%%) (Alien) Super Power appears, you can choose for Mulder to gain 1, 2, or 3 XP. (It's not cumulative.) We would choose 3, but your mileage may vary.

**Searching for Samantha** will draw a card each time you search your deck for something. First resolve the search effect, then draw a card.

# [Franklin Richards](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-021.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FAN-021

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Franklin is one of the most powerful beings in the multiverse. So powerful he has been able to, from a young age, create a **Pocket Universe**. Here's what happens when he does that:

* Move each Character other than Franklin to the side of the playing space. **They are now in a separate part of the game.**
    * A **Pocket Universe** has only front and back rows (no resource row).  
    * When the characters are moved to the **Pocket Universe** they stay in the same rows they were in in the original universe. They keep all their counters and their orientation (ready/exhausted; face up/face down).  
    * The **Pocket Universe** is still in the same overall game as the original universe. So cards don't "appear" or "leave play" when they move from the original universe to the **Pocket Universe** or vice versa.  
    * Cards in the **Pocket Universe** cannot attack or otherwise affect cards in the original universe and vice versa.  
    * The Uniqueness rules don't apply across the **Pocket Universe** and original universe. (For example, you could have a Human Torch in both Universes.)  
    * Note: Your hand, deck, KO pile, and out-of-game piles can be accessed in both the original universe and the **Pocket Universe** (more on this below).  
* Each player who has characters in a **Pocket Universe** will take a separate turn in that **Pocket Universe** after their normal turn (before the next player's normal turn, and including the turn Franklin creates the **Pocket Universe**).  
    * First take your normal turn. During this turn, ignore the **Pocket Universe**.  
    * After your turn is over, you then take a **Pocket Universe** turn. During this turn, ignore the original universe.  
    * The cards you play on a particular turn can only affect that turn's universe.  
* A **Pocket Universe** turn sequence is a little different than a normal turn, as follows:  
    * Start of turn  
        * Note that there is no Draw Phase.  
    * Recovery Phase  
    * Formation Step  
        * Note that there is no Build Phase because there are no Recruit Points or resource rows in the **Pocket Universe**.  
    * Main Phase  
        * This works just like a "Normal" Main Phase in regard to combats.  
        * You can play Plot Twists from our hand to affect a **Pocket Universe**.
        * You can discard Locations from your hand to generate a power symbol in the **Pocket Universe**. (Since the **Pocket Universe** has no resource row, there are no locations to turn face down to generate a power symbol.)  
        * You can discard characters from your hand to Power Up characters in a **Pocket Universe**.
        * When a character is KO'd in a **Pocket Universe**, they go to the normal KO pile. Similarly, if a character leaves play due to an effect, it works the same as if the character were still in the original universe. For example, if an effect returned the character to its owner's hand, it would go to that hand as normal.
    * End of turn
* If there is more than one **Pocket Universe** in the game, each player will take their normal turn first, then a **Pocket Universe** turn for each **Pocket Universe** they have characters in, starting with the first **Pocket Universe** created, then the second, etc.
    * Cards in one **Pocket Universe** cannot attack or otherwise affect cards in another **Pocket Universe**.
* When Franklin leaves play, the characters from each **Pocket Universe** he created pop back into the original universe part of the game, in the same rows and with the same orientation they were in their **Pocket Universe**.
    * If this leads to more than one character with the same name on your side, KO all except one (your choice).

# [Frohike](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-007.jpg), [Langly](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-008.jpg), and [Byers](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-009.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^XFB-007, ^XFB-008, ^XFB-009

*Set: The X-Files Battles*

**The Lone Gunmen** lets these characters power up each other. When one of them powers up another one, it will trigger each of their other Keyword Powers. For example, if you discard Byers to power up Frohike (or if you discard Frohike to power up Byers), it will trigger Byers' **Science** power and Frohike's **Photography** power. You can resolve those powers in either order.

**Note:** Powering up one of these characters the normal way wont' cause their powers to trigger.
