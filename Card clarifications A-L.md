# Card clarifications and FAQs

The following card-specific information is a culmination of clarifications, rule changes, and FAQs from various sources. After each item (or series of items), there's a "Source" indicator that specifies whether the item came from:
* Rule inserts from the set
* An official FAQ doc published by Upper Deck Entertainment (UDE FAQ)
* An official rule change, clarification, or errata
* A community source, such as Facebook or Discord. (Some of these have been officially approved by UDE and, if so, are noted in the source citation). 

**Note**: There have been some minor editorial liberties taken (not all are exact quotations from the main source). These changes are mainly cosmetic or made to help understand context outside of the rule-sheet and do not fundamentally change the intent of the original text.

# [Abduction](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-037.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^XFB-037

*Set: The X-Files Battles*

The abducted character will re-enter the game with wound counters on it equal to its printed health minus one. So if it has 3 printed health, it will re-enter the game with two wounds. **Note:** This won't trigger any powers that look for "when a character gets wounded**.

# [Abomination](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu1-033.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MCU1-033

*Set: MCU Battles*
  
Abomination’s **Give Me a Real Fight!** Power forces a player’s first attack to include a specific character and the defender must be Abomination. However if either that character can’t attack or Abomination can’t be attacked, the effect does nothing. Also, the player can choose not to attack at all on their turn.

# [Adam Warlock](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-001.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: ^GAL-001, ^GAL-002

*Set: Galactic Guardians* 
 
At [Level 1](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-001.jpg), if Adam Warlock gets KO'd by getting stunned, **Prepare for Rebirth** will cause him to gain an XP and become [Level 2](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-002.jpg) while in the stunned position. (If a power like Hex prevents him from leveling up, he'll remain at Level 1 but still heal his wounds.)

*Q:   If I don’t use his Emerge power, will he recover normally during my next Recovery Phase?*

A: Yes. But he’s huge! Spend that ![](%%Might%%) (Might) and start bashing with him right away, man!

# [Agatha Harkness](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-013.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FAN-013

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

If Agatha appearing on your side KOs an Agatha that was already on your side (due to uniqueness), **Ancient Sorceress** will count the Agatha that was KO'd.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Ahab](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FUT-023.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FUT-023

*Set: Futures Past*

You start the game with a private out-of-game Hound pile. The pile must contain exactly 4 different supporting characters of your choice with (Brotherhood), (Resistance), and/or (X-men) who do not share any names and do not have any copies in your deck. For the game, Hounds lose their printed team affiliations, and gain the (Sentinel) affiliation.

^(Source: Rule Insert)

# [Ajax](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-012.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MFM-012

*Set: Deadpool & Friends*  

Ajax's **Pain Tolerance** power says he can only be KO'd by fatal wounds at the end of a turn. A character has fatal wounds if it has at least as many wounds as its health. So Ajax can have any amount of wounds but won't actually get KO'd until the end of a turn.

^(Source: Rule insert)

---

Q: Does his power imply that fatal wounds at the end of the turn is the ONLY way to KO him? For example, if a character power or card effect would KO him directly (such as Simon Trask's Human Sentinel One), is he still KO'd?

A: Fatal wounds can’t KO him until end of turn. Other effects (like Simon Trask) can KO him normally.

# [Alcatraz](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HAM-019.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^HAM-019

*Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.*  

When the character in “prison” turns face up, the player who used Alcatraz decides which row on its original side it goes back to.

# Alex Krycek
## [Alex Krycek (MC)](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-022.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^XFB-022, ^XFB-023

*Set: The X-Files Battles*

**Fight or Die** can choose any random Main Character, even ones not in the combat. WE suggest rolling a die to determine which character gets stunned. If Kryceck gets stunned this way, he will get removed from combat. If a stunned Main Character is chosen, nothing happens. If a hidden Main Character is chosen, stun it.

^(Source: Rule Insert)

## [Alex Krycek (SC)](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-033.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^XFB-033

*Set: The X-Files Battles*

**We All Have a Life in Our Hands** says to choose a unique character. This counts any character that doesn't have **Swarm**. To secretly choose a character we suggest jotting its name down on a piece of paper. **Note:** If the character you chose gets KO'd but then later another character with the same name is in play, the new character does NOT count for **We All Have a Life in Our Hands**.

# [Alicia Masters](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-009.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FAN-009

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Here's an example of how her **Neo-Realistic Sculptor** works. The Thing is on your side, who has 10/6 ATK/DEF. While Alicia is also on your side, his ATK/DEF become  10/10.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Alien Symbiote](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SPF-021.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^SPF-021

*Set: Spider Friends*

>If a character that is equipped with the Alien Symbiote gains an equipment card, put the Alien Symbiote in the KO pile.

The text on Alien Symbiote says that it cannot be KO'd but the One-Equip rule in the rule book will override this text if the character is equipped with another equipment card.  Cards must explicitly (not implicitly) override game mechanics and this was ruled that it was not intended to override the one-equipment rule.

# [Alter Ego](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MCU7-019.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MCU7-019

*Set: Friendly Neighborhood*  

"Make up a new name" means you must rename a character card with something that is not already the name of a character in the Vs System 2PCG. Some examples of made-up names are "Night Monkey", "Dr. Baby", and "The Fudge".

Removing a character's current names (which also makes the character lose all its **AKA**s) and replacing it lets you get around the uniqueness rules. For example, if you change Spider-Man's name to Night Monkey, you can now play or have another copy of that Spider-Man cad in play at the same time since they have different names. (On the other hand, you can no longer discard a Spider-Man character to power up Night Monkey.)

If a character references itself in its text box, those references will also use its new name.

# [Angel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/RES-001.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: ^RES-001, ^RES-002

*Set: Resistance*  

When Angel levels up, he transforms into [Archangel](#wiki_archangel). When this happens, he keeps his orientation (ready/exhausted, face-up/face-down), all of his counters, and any effects on him. Also note Archangel doesn’t have a Level 1 version. The only way to becomehim normally is to start the game with (Resistance) Level 1 Angel as your Main Character.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Angel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-001.jpg)/[Angelus](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-028.jpg) (MC) 
^CardNumber: ^TBB-001, ^TBB-028

*Set: The Buffy Battles*  

Level 1 Angel and Angelus can transform between each other. However, when you build a deck you must choose either Angel or Angelus to be your starting Main Character. (You must lock in your decision at the time you build your deck, not after you see what Main Character your opponent is using.) When Angel transforms into Angelus or vice versa, he keeps his orientation (ready/exhausted, face up/face down), all of his counters (including XP), and any effects on him.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Angela](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-015.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^GAL-015

*Set: Galactic Guardians*  

**An Angel From the Heavens** makes it difficult for Angela to be solo attacked. An attacker must have ![](%%Flight%%) or ![](%%Range%%) (or both) to solo attack her. 

When Angela opens a **Bridge to Heven**, you must put each revealed character onto your side. This may cause some characters to be KO'd due to the uniqueness rules.

^(Source: Rule insert)

# [Annihilus](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FRI-001.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FRI-001, ^FRI-002

*Set: The Frightful*

**Lord of the Negative Zone** allows you to include up to two Negative Zone Locations in your deck. (If Mister Fantastic is in your deck your Invention pile will also include its usual two Negative Zones.)

**The Living Death That Walks** grants 1 XP for each of the listed actions. So if Annihilus attacks, strikes, and stuns a defending character, but somehow doesn't wound or KO it, he will gain 3 XP.

When Annihilus levels up, you'll shuffle his Level 1 card into your deck. While it's in your hand you may reveal it for his **Continuous Rebirth** power. (You can also discard it to Power Up Annihilus. Put the discarded card into your Level Up zone, which is where his Level 2 card started the game.

# [Anya](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-018.jpg) 
^CardNumber: ^TBB-018

*Set: The Buffy Battles*

Her **Newly Human and Strangely Literal** power ignores all stat increases including +1/+1 counters. It doesn’t remove the counters – they just have no effect this turn.

# [Archangel](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/RES-002.jpg)

# [Ardina](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HER-008.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^HER-008

*Set: The Herald*  

**Clone of the Silver Surfer** refers to the "card title" Silver Surfer. This means the name at the very top of the card must be Silver Surfer. **AKA**s don't count.

^(Source: Rule insert)

---
If Ardina appears via some mechanism other than being recruited (such as being brought along by Lockjaw or Legacy), you do not have to pay the additional cost of wounding Silver Surfer.

*Set: The Utopia Battles*  

**Psionic Exoskeleton** is a combat power, but its effect lasts for the rest of the turn.

# Arnim Zola
## [Arnim Zola](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-001.jpg) (MC-Illustrated)
^CardNumber: ^CV1-001, ^CV1-002

*Set: Crossover* 
 
**ESP Box** takes effect once the game starts and lasts the whole game (even while Arnim Zola is stunned, after he levels up, and even after he is KO’d). You can play any Equipment as a Supporting Character, regardless of whether you have a character with a matching team affiliation. When you play one as a Supporting Character, it’s no longer an Equipment. If it has a power that references “Equipped Character,” it is its own equipped character. When the card leaves play it will go back to being an Equipment. You may still play an Equipment normally and equip it to one of your characters (including on an Equipment that you played as a Supporting Character). 

When Arnim Zola enters **A New Robot Body**, your new Equipment-turned-Main Character will have ATK/DEF equal to its cost, 1 (Health), Swarm, and it will count as its own “Equipped Character,” just like with ESP Box. When that body gets KO’d, it can use this power again to jump into another robot body, and so on. Note: if you want to use a Wild Special Location to pay for this power, it must match the team affiliation of the Main Character using this power.

*Set: Power & Reality*  

1. If you understand how **I Wrote an Algorithm** works, goto 2. If not, goto 3.
2. Cool. We're done here.
3. Start by reading Part 1 of the Super Power. Then if exactly one face-up enemy character has more ATK than each other face-up enemy character, go to Part 2 of the Super Power and stun that character. Otherwise go to Part 3 and put two -1/-1 counters on each enemy character. If everything now makes sense, goto 2 above. If not, goto 3 above.

# [Astra](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FRE-011.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FRE-011

*Set: Freedom Force*

To create a **Clone** put a token copy of the chosen character onto your side. The copy has all the printed characteristics (name, team, cost, ATK/DEF, Health, powers) of that character but nothing else. It appears face up and ready and does not appear with any counters or status effects (like **Burn**). Uniqueness does apply to the token.

# Avalanche
## [Avalanche](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BOM-009.jpg) (Brotherhood)
^CardNumber: ^BOM-009

*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*  

Avalanche’s **Sustained Seismic Waves** power gets stronger each time he uses it. However, if you play a new copy of Avalanche later, the super power on that copy will start over.

Q: If I **Hypnotize** a Ripley #8 L2 that started the game as Sister Ripley, which Level 1 Character does she become? Sister Ripley or Ripley#8 level 1?

A: Ripley #8 Level 1. A character will always become the level one version of what it is.  

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel)

---
Q: Does **Hex** prevent a **Hypnotized** character from turning back into Level 2 at the start of my next turn?

A: No, Hypnotize creates a modifier with an expiration that temporarily makes a character its Level 1 version. When that modifier expires it becomes its Level 2 version again, and this is not considered Leveling up.

# [Baron von Strucker](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MCU4-013.jpg) (SC-MCU Villains)
^CardNumber: ^MCU4-013

*Set: Power & Reality*  

To resolve the **Age of Miracles**, first choose a Supporting Character with 1 printed Health other than Baron von Strucker. Then randomly select one of the six new Keyword Powers. that character gains the new power until it leaves play. (To randomly select a power, we recommend rolling a 6-sided die where 1 is **Dark** and 6 is **Wise**.)

**Note:** If you use **Age of Miracles** more than once on the same character, it's possible for them to get the same power twice. This is great with **Dark** and **Sly**, but not great with the other powers.

# [Blackbird](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/DAR-017.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^DAR-017

*Set: Into the Darkness*

The Blackbird introduces a new kind of equipment to the game - Vehicles! When you play a Vehicle, equip it to one character like normal. But whenever you rearrange your Formation (including on the turn you played the Vehicle), you may have characters on your side get on or off the Vehicle. Choose any number up to the Vehicle's Passenger Limit (found next to "Vehicle" on its type line), put them next to each other in the same row, and equip the Vehicle to all of them. Here are more details:

- All passengers must legally be able to have the Vehicle equipped.
- If any already had an equipment, KO that equipment (because a character can only have one equipment at a time). 
	- If an equipment gets equipped to a passenger, it stops being equipped to the Vehicle, but the Vehicle is not KO'd as long as it has any other passengers.
- When you rearrange your Formation, you CAN remove passengers from the Vehicle. (They stop having it equipped to them.)
- When you're done rearranging, there must be at least one passenger.
- Put the Vehicle card close to each of its passengers and announce who is "on board."

**While a Vehicle has only one passenger, it works just like any other equipment.** If its passenger gets turned face down or leaves play, the Vehicle will get KO'd. If an effect moves the passenger to a different row, the Vehicle will move with them.

**While a Vehicle has more than one passenger, it works a little differently.** If a passenger gets turned face down or leaves play, it becomes unequipped from the Vehicle, but the Vehicle remains equipped to the other passenger(s). If all passengers do get turned face down or leave play at the same time, they all become unequipped from the Vehicle and the Vehicle gets KO'd. 

If an effect moves all passengers to a different row, the Vehicle goes with them. If an effect causes one or more passengers to be in one row and the others to be in a different row, the controller of the Vehicle chooses which group of passengers stays equipped to the Vehicle.

The X-Jet has up to four effects depending on how many passengers it has. For example, while there are exactly three face-up passengers, they will each have ![](%%Flight%%) (Flight) , +1/+1 and **Dodge**. If one passenger becomes unequipped, then the other two will now have ![](%%Flight%%) (Flight) and +1/+1.

# [Black Bolt](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MMU-037.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: ^MMU-037, ^MMU-038

*Set: Monsters Unleashed!*  

Black Bolt’s Super Powers use the Amplify ability. When you use a Super Power, if you discard a Location (instead of turning it face-down in your resource row), you get the Amplify text. Previous Amplify Super Powers grant an effect to begin with but a larger effect if you Amplify it. Black Bolt’s powers only grant an effect if you Amplify them.

^(Source: Rule insert)

---

Q: If I use Black Bolt's **Sonic Whisper** and Black Bolt is Lethal (by playing "A Killer Voice" for example), will the opponent be KO'd?

A: If you are attacking, yes. Lethal only activates when attacking and when you cause a wound. Because **Sonic Whisper** is a combat ability, and stunning causes a wound, the opponent will be KO'd (barring any other effects that prevent the wound, etc.).

*Set: A-Force*

Q: If Satana is in play and Black Cat attacks a defender and uses **Cross their Path** to Daze that character, is it KO'd by Lethal?

A: Daze counts as stunning, but Lethal was changed to work when a wounding a defending supporting character. Since Daze does not wound, lethal is not applied.

## [Black Cat](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SPF-012.jpg) (SC - unaffiliated)
^CardNumber: ^SPF-012

*Set: Spider-Friends*  

**Personal Loyalty**  
Black Cat has often wavered between being a hero and a villain. In the game she doesn’t have a team affiliation and is neither Good nor Evil… until she’s on a side (she is neither Good nor Evil while she is in your hand, deck, or KO pile). Then if Spider-Man is your main character, he has a good influence on her and she’ll ferociously fight alongside her partner. But if he’s not your main character, she’ll go back to slinking around as a criminal.

You can only equip this to an enemy Supporting Character. Then during your Draw Phase, you can pay an ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy) to bring that character to your side until it leaves play.

**Note:** Any player who is an enemy of the character that has **Black Oil** equipped can use its **Give It Time** power. For example, in a 3-player game, Player A might put **Black Oil** on Player B's character. But Player C could use **Give it Time** to steal that character.

And his **Bounced Off His Belly** power represents projectiles getting bounced back at any ranged attackers. Note: In the event that Blob somehow had ![](%%Range%%) he would not strike back using his own ATK because Bounced Off His Belly’s strike back would override his normal strike back.

# [Boomerang](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SFO-008.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^SFO-008

*Set: Spidey-Foes*  

**Specialized Boomerangs**  
Boomerang can "throw" a different Boomerang each turn at one front row and one back row enemy. You can choose a front row character on one side and a back row character on a different side. If there are no enemy front row characters you can just choose an enemy back row character (and vice versa).

# [Break the Fourth Wall](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-019.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MFM-019

*Set: Deadpool & Friends*  

This plot twist really lets you get in the game. When you put a “Me” token onto your side, you get to choose a team affiliation and your age will determine your ATK and DEF. You’ll have Leader because you’re still in charge of your team, but don’t worry – if you get KO’d you don’t lose the game because you’re also still a player. We figure you have more questions about all this, so let’s dive in. 

* **How do you prove your age?** If you’re at a tournament you’ll need an ID with a birthday. If you don’t have one, we’ll just pretend you’re 11.  

* **Does this card have different power levels for different players depending on their age?** Yes.  

* **Isn’t that ageist?** Great question. Think about it this way: Yes.  

* **What happens if I’m 29 and tomorrow’s my birthday, but then it turns to midnight in the middle of the game?** You’ll become a 3/0 and get stunned.  

* **Isn’t that kind of stupid?** Play faster next time.

* **I feel like you’re not taking this seriously.** That’s not a question.

Q: Scenario: I have two face-up exhausted characters on the same affiliation, but one is Frozen. Can I still play Brotherhood to ready one of the two characters?

A: You can choose a character or characters who are frozen during your turn. They will not ready.
If you choose one frozen and one exhausted character, only the exhausted character will ready not the one that is frozen.

Q: Another question about Cable and his super power **Advanced Cybernetics**. If I pay the yellow, then declare an attack can I equip Combistick onto him during the combat? Basically does that super change change all team symbols and what not on the card to X-men?

Q: How does his **Ultimate Soldier** power work?

A: When you activate his power while he’s attacking, it means the defender will get stunned at the end of the combat even if the attackers’ ATK isn’t as much as the defender’s DEF.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

Q: What happens if I use his power but the combat gets canceled?

A: Cable’s power has no effect since the combat didn’t come to its natural conclusion. It doesn’t matter if the combat was canceled due to a card effect like **Think Again** or due to all of the attackers getting stunned.

Q: What happens if he’s team attacking and I use his power, but then he gets stunned before the combat resolves?

A: His power will still trigger and stun the defender even though Cable himself got stunned before the combat resolved. This is because once an effect resolves and creates a modifier, it is independent from the source that created it.

**Every Problem Has a Solution** counts Keyword, Super, and Level Up text powers with the word "can" or "can't" in their definition, even if the definition isn't printed on the card. (For example, the keyword **Dodge** doesn't always have its definition on a card but it means "This character can't be ranged attacked.") "Text powers" means this power doesn't affect ![](%%Flight%%)or ![](%%Range%%). It also counts text powers that are granted to a card from another source, like a Plot Twist or an Equipment, but that aren't printed on the card itself.

**Note:** If a power says "This power can't be turned off.", **Every Problem Has a Solution** will try to take it away (because it says "can't") but it won't be able to do so.

A: Yes

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel)

> If multiple characters "appear" at once, Copycat is unable to copy any of them.

With the reveal of Copycat, the question arose on her interaction with [Singularity](https://i.imgur.com/3vlwcdR.jpg).  Specifically, if multiple characters (other than Copycat) appear at once, which SC's powers, if any, does Copycat inherit?  The ruling is that if multiple triggers occur simultaneously for Copycat, she will not gain any powers.  The reasoning is that she only gains powers "until another supporting character appears on your side."  This means that when multiple characters appear at once, the duration of her effect has already expired by the time it resolves.  From head judge: "if a modifier’s duration would cause it to expire before it is created, then the modifier is never created."  Ultimately, Copycat needs only a single character to appear in order to resolve as intended.

Q: If I play a red Cosmic Cube and call "Sentinel," for example, would it remove both Alpha Combat Units and Executive Types? Or what if I called "Captain America"? Would it remove Nomad or Supreme Leader? 

A: The Cosmic Cubes mention that you can choose a card and then "... remove any number of cards with that name... " (from where depends on the specific Cube). So, the "name" in this case would include:

- Cards with the title that matches the card you chose.
- Cards with **AKA** that matches the name of the card you chose.
- **BUT NOT** cards with a mantle that sounds like the name of the card you chose.

Sounds confusing? It kind of is. [Check out this infographic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11W764QPzEByqs-LJoICGQuArPRwur_A_/view?usp=sharing) for a visual example of how this does or doesn't apply.

Q: If my opponent has H.A.M.M.E.R. Cloak on his side and I play Dagger, is she KO'd by him before she can convert the -1 counters to +1?

A: She is not KO'd. She would get the +1 counters. Here are the steps when a character is recruited:

1. Announce the name of the character.
2. The character moves from whatever zone that it is in to the Resolving Zone. At this point it is considered “recruited”.
3. If any power would trigger off a character being recruited, resolve that effect, then continue. 
4. The character moves from the Resolving Zone to the Play Zone. 
5. Any powers are now active. 
6. Process any “appears with” text. 
7. At this point the character has now appeared.

So, as of step 5, Dagger's powers are active.

Cloak's power doesn't technically trigger until right after step 7.

Daredevil, Rhino, and Juggernaut have effects that allow an enemy *character* to spend a power symbol to do something.

**Protector of Hell's Kitchen**

Q: If I attack Daredevil with Mary Walker (Typhoid Mary) and I put a -1/-1 counter on Daredevil and one on the only character he's protecting which happens to have 1 defense (like Black Widow), KO'ing her, does Daredevil gets an XP?

A: The turn player decides the order per the rule book under "Timing." Daredevil's level up power has an intervening "if" clause, which means the condition must be true when it triggers AND when it resolves. So if the turn player decides to resolve Mary Walker's power before Daredevil's power, Daredevil will not get an XP because he won't be protecting anyone once his level up power resolves. On the other hand, if the turn player decides to resolve Daredevil's power before Mary's then Daredevil will gain an XP.

*Set: Utopia Battles*

Q: Dark Beast SC2. "Pay 2 less to play evil equipment." Outside of Darkhold, how does one define "evil" equipment?

A: [Good or Evil](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/good_or_evil) affiliations are typically based on the [Team Affiliation](/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_team_affiliation) of the card. 

For example: Power Loader would be Good because it has The Company team affiliation, but Omega Machine would be Evil because it is H.A.M.M.E.R. affiliated.

However, for this specific question it should be noted that Darkhold is neutral. It does require you to have a Marvel character, but Marvel isn't a Team Affiliation and doesn't make the card Good or Evil. So Darkhold - even though it can only be equipped to an Evil character -  is not Evil itself (and would *not* benefit from Dark Beast's power).

**Deconstruct the Universe**  
When Deconstructs the Universe, an entire concept of the game gets removed for the rest of the game (even if she leaves play). If, as a result of this, the wording of a card’s power is unclear, the part that is unclear does nothing. Here’s how removing each concept works: 

* **+1/+1 and -1/-1 counters:** Remove all of those counters from the game. Remove the phrases “+1/+1 counter” and “-1/-1 counter” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause these counters to enter the game in any way 
 
* **Equipment**: Remove all Equipment cards everywhere from the game. This includes all sides, decks, hands, KO piles, and Equipment that are already removed from the game. This also includes any cards that were once Equipment cards but don’t currently count as Equipment (such as a face-down resource or an Equipment that has become a character via Arnim Zola’s   
**ESP Box** ). Remove the term “Equipment” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Equipment to enter the game in any way.  

* **Keyword text:** Removing this concept doesn’t affect ![](%%Flight%%) and ![](%%Range%%). Remove all Keyword text from the game, including powers that “can’t be turned off”. Remove the term “Keyword” from all card text. For the rest of the game, ignore any effects that would cause Keyword text to enter the game in any way.  
 
* **Levels:** All Main Characters everywhere become Level 1 if possible. Remove all remaining Level 2 and higher Main Characters from the game.

At Level 2, while Deacon is melee attacking a Supporting Character, there are two likely results (unless the defender manages not to get stunned): If the defender gets KO'd, deacon Frost's **Vampire** will gan a vitality counter. And if the defender gets wounded but not KO'd, then his **Doppelgänger Powers** will give you a copy of that character.

*Set: Deadpool & Friends*

> Hiya kids, it’s your old pal, Deadpool. Guess what? I’m the First character in the game to go all the way to Level 4. There’s probably a break-the-fourth-wall joke in there somewhere, but I haven’t found it yet. Anyhoo, the powers that be want me to tell you that even though I’m now on two different main character cards, the (X-Men) and (Underworld) versions of me can’t level up into each other.  
> 
> It’s because a main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork. And guess what? I don’t mean to brag but I’m actually a designer now. You know all the cards in this set that you love? That’s right -- I designed them. (All the cards that you hate were designed by those other two dummies.) Designing stuff is sweet. You can pretty much do whatever you want.  
> 
> I like designing so much, I wanted to do some while I was in the game too. My new main character can **nerf** stuff, **errata** stuff, and even **ban** stuff. Check it out:  

**I'm Taking Over From These Idiot Designers**  
  
* **Nerf:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks, and KO piles are 0/1 with 1 and nothing can ever, ever change that.  

* **Errata:** Name a character. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles lose and can’t gain powers (including ![](%%Flight%%) and ![](%%Range%%)). 
 
* **Ban:** Name a character and choose a number. Put all supporting characters with that name on enemy sides into their owner’s hands. For the rest of the game, supporting characters with that name on enemy players’ sides, and in enemy hands, decks and KO piles have a cost equal to the chosen number and nothing can ever, ever change that. (Except banning it again. You know the old saying: “If you really, really hate a card, ban it twice.”) Any effects that would increase or decrease what an enemy player pays to recruit a banned card are ignored.  

Here are some quick tips:  

* If you steal a character with one of those effects the effect will stop because it’s not an enemy character anymore. Yay! However, if it goes back to an enemy side the effect will turn on again. Boo!  

* When you Ban a character, you can name any number you want. Even a million bazillion. Try it, it’s fun!

* If someone tries to tell you that this isn’t really how nerfing, errata-ing, and banning works, you just take your katana and do some "development” on them, if you know what I mean.

Q: If I use **Merc With a Mouth** to make my Gambit or Dazzler Lethal, will they KO a character by using their Super Powers to stun them?

**Man, There's Noone Left to Kill**
Q: If I’m playing with 3 or 4 players, do ALL enemy characters have to be stunned for Deadpool to gain an XP?

A: No. At the end of your turn, if any enemy player has no face-up characters, Deadpool will gain 1 XP. (If two or more players have all stunned characters, Deadpool still only gains 1 XP.)

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

---

Q: What’s going on with his **Oh, there’s someone! Hi there!** power?

A: If all of an enemy player’s characters are stunned, Deadpool can attack that player. If the attack stuns the player, that player is KO’d and is out of the game. (The same way as if his Main Character has been KO’d.)

Q: What does “the player counts as a supporting character” mean?

A: It means that if Deadpool is attacking you, you can play Plot Twists that would help a supporting character to increase your stats or otherwise survive the combat.

Q: What if an effect puts a +1/+1 or -1/-1 counter on me while I’m defending against Deadpool?

A: It goes on you. If this puts you to 0 DEF, you’ll get stunned (and KO’d). If it makes your stats better, that could help you survive this attack and will stick around to help you if he attacks you again on a later turn.

Q: What if I get KO’d?

A: You’re out of the game, the same way as if your Main Character got KO’d. (You do not actually lose consciousness.)

Q: After Deadpool uses his **Oh, there’s Someone! Hi there!** power, can he team attack a player?

A: No, the other characters don’t know what a player is.

# [Death](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-001.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^BLK-001, ^BLK-002
*Set: Black Order*  

Death is **Amortal** which means:

* She has no level (She is beyond such mortal trappings).  
* She starts with her card that has infinite health. (Her other card has 8 health, also known as sideways infinity.)  
* She can't be face down. If she would be turned face down, switch her with her other card instead and leave it face up. For example when she gets stunned, instead of turning her face down, switch her with her other card which will remain face up. She still suffers other effects from the stun such as losing the +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters, gaining a wound, and becoming exhausted.  
* If she would be hidden, instead switch her with her other card which will remain face up and place her in the ready position.  
* Amortal can't be turned off.
 
Since Death doesn't turn face down, she can be stunned multiple times in a single turn. However, if she takes fatal wounds she's not really defeated. She's just temporarily lost interest in this mortal battle. (The player who was using her is defeated, though.) 

**Note:** While death is technically two cards, you could slip her into a single clear card sleeve with her cards back to back. Then when she would turn face down, you can just flip her to her other "side."  

**Mistress of the Infinity Well** allows each player to draw an extra card each time you draw cards. For example, when you draw your usual two cards during your Draw Phase, you'll draw an extra one. And if you have a **Genius** in play that lets you draw a card, you'll draw an extra one then, too.

When Devil-Slayer and the defender strike each other: 

* Devil-Slayer can be stunned as normal.  
* A hidden character can get stunned as normal. (Wound it and change it from ready to exhausted.) 
* If Devil-Slayer’s strike would stun an already-stunned character, just wound it instead.

Q: I have Devil-Slayer. My opponent has a stunned character in their back row and a face-up character in their front row. Can Devil-Slayer attack the stunned character in the back row? I'm asking because the comp rules state that a stunned character "can't be protected".

A: No. Devil Slayer still has to follow all the other legal attack rules. He doesn't have ![](%%Flight%%) so he can't ignore the front row.

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*   

Q: Does “an exact replica” trigger once for each Doombot in play. I.e. I have MC Doom and two Doombots on my side. Doom is stunned and would be wounded. An exact replica triggers on one of my two Doombots and the MC Doom is the random card chosen. Before he would be wounded, does the second Doombots keyword trigger and I pick another card at random to have the chance to potentially prevent the wound a second time?

A: First thing to know is it, is NOT a trigger. A trigger will ALWAYS start with the words, "When, Whenever, At". This is a replacement power. In short, you can try once per Doombot.

If there are multiple Doombots, that means there are multiple modifiers trying to replace the same event. If there are multiple replacement modifiers trying to apply to the same event, you choose one to apply.

If after you processed the replacement modifier, the event no longer happens, then the rest of the replacement modifiers do nothing. If the event still would happen, then you apply another replacement modifier. You keep doing this until the event no longer happens, or you have ran out of replacement modifiers.

In the case of Doombot, the event in question is Doctor Doom being wounded. As long as he is still being wounded, you may continue to try to apply replacement modifiers.

Q: Do "Appears" powers work when character are brought into play with Dramatic Entrance? I'm not sure because it says, "put into play."

A: It does not matter how a character enters play. If it goes from not being in play, to being in play, it has "appeared" whether that is from recruiting, or some other effect putting it into play.

Q: How does Dramatic Entrance work if I bring a Loki 7 drop SC into play with it? Does Loki draw me a card if it was the first PT I played that turn? Or since it wasn't in play, it doesn't grant me the benefit? If it doesn't, then does the next PT I play that turn trigger Loki's Schemer power?

A: If you bring in Loki SC with Dramatic Entrance, Schemer will not trigger. At the time you PLAYED the plot twist, Loki was not in play. Once he is in play, he does not look back in time and see that you played a plot twist. Also if you play another plot twist, Schemer will still not trigger because it is not your first plot twist played this turn.

Q: If you dramatic entrance a Wasp or Ant-man can you just Shrink the combat?

Q: If I use Dramatic Entrance to put Adam Warlock into play as the new Defender, what happens since he comes into play stunned due to his **Evolutionary Cocoon**?

# [Even the Odds](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-076.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MNB-076

*Set: The Marvel Battles*

Q: How does this card work?

A: You can use it to “reset” an enemy back to its base stats. You remove all +1/+1 counters from it and any modifiers that were affecting its base ATK and DEF are overridden or suppressed.

^(Source - UDE FAQ)

Q: What happens if after I play Even the Odds on a character to “reset” it, my opponent plays a Plot Twist to increase its ATK?

A: Even the Odds resets a character one time and then has no further effect. So the Plot Twist will work normally.

Q: Even the Odds targeting Blackheart. He resets to a 4/4 for the rest of the combat, yes? His power does not turn on until the next combat he becomes involved in?

A: Even the Odds creates a continuous modifier that "suppresses" any other continuous modifier affecting ATK/DEF for THAT COMBAT. The modifiers will "turn back on" after the combat has passed.

Q: If I play Even The Odds on a character with -1/-1 counters does it remove them?

A: No, Even the odds does not remove -1/-1 counters, as it says, it only removes +1/+1 counters.

Q: Hello, a question about the Perfect Organism and Even The Odds. If I use the ability to strike with double of the attack, (**This Thing is Huge! It's...It's Big!** / **[Fearless](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/glossary#wiki_fearless)**) and my opponent plays Even The Odds, what happen?

A: This **Thing is Huge! It's... It's Big!** does not actually modify the ATK. It is modifying how hard it strikes during combat resolution. Normally when you strike, you strike an equal amount to your ATK. This power (and the Daredevil one) changes the rules of the game so that you are striking with double that amount, or triple with Amplify.

# [Evil Deadpool](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MFM-005.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MFM-005, ^MFM-006

*Set: Deadpool & Friends* 
  
Made from Deadpool’s discarded body parts that fused back together into a new person, Evil Deadpool gains XP whenever you discard a character. This includes powering up as well as any effect that causes you to “discard” a card (whether you or your opponent controls the effect).

**Merc With an Evil Mouth**  
Evil Deadpool loves being Evil. That’s why he can grant Evil characters on your side the new keyword, Evil Lethal. Evil Lethal works just like regular Lethal except after you KO the supporting defender you laugh evilly. (If you’re unable to laugh evilly you’ll still resolve the effect as much as possible and KO the defender.)  

**It's Like You, But Eviler!**  
Evil Deadpool’s Level 2 super power puts Good characters into play but turns them Evil and adds the word “Evil” at the beginning of their name. Changing their name DOES affect the uniqueness rules. For example, it would allow you to have “Iron Man” and “Evil Iron Man” on your side at the same time. However, you would not be able to add “Evil” to regular Deadpool because then his name would be “Evil Deadpool” which is the same name as your main character. And Evil Deadpool hates Deadpool anyway.

*Set: The Alien Battles*  

**Facehuggers and Capturing Characters**   
If you have [Ovomorphs](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/small/ALN-035.jpg) in your deck (the eggs that make Facehuggers), you’ll use the Facehugger Pile. 

* The Facehugger Pile includes three Facehugger token characters and one Extended Incubation card. These cards start the game out of play. (If more than one player is using Ovomorphs, they will each use their own Facehugger Pile.)   
* When an Ovomorph is ready to Hatch, reveal a random card from your Facehugger Pile.  
* If you reveal the Extended Incubation card, the Ovomorph doesn’t open yet. Shuffle the Extended Incubation card back into your Facehugger Pile.  
* If you reveal a Facehugger token character, KO its Ovomorph, put the Facehugger into your Back Row, and it captures an enemy supporting character. (It can capture a face-up or stunned supporting character.)  

“Capture” is a new game action that means:  

 - Remove the Captive card from the game, but keep any wound counters on it.  
 - Put the Captive card next to (or underneath) its Captor to make it clear who its Captor is.  
 - When the Captor leaves play, put its Captive back into play stunned in its owner’s back row.  
 - You may pay an ![](%%Alien%%)(Alien) at the start of your Build Phase. If you do, KO the Facehugger and put its captive into its owner’s KO pile. Then you may put an (Xenomorph) character from your hand into your back row. (This represents the new Xenomorph bursting out of the captive’s chest.)  
 - Note: Put the KO’d Facehugger token back into your Facehugger Pile.

>Fin Fang Foom cannot attack a row if any character in that row is an illegal target

For example, if [Xenomorph Ambusher](https://i.imgur.com/XHtrRFS.jpg) was in the back row, Fin Fang Foom cannot declare an attack on that row due to the Ambusher's "Camouflage" keyword.

^(Source: Official Clarification)

> If an effect would remove a defender from the attack when Fin Fang Foom is the attacker, that defender remains removed from the attack even if it did not change rows

This ruling was made to clarify how Fin Fang Foom would interact with cards such as [Dramatic Entrance](https://i.imgur.com/bit8aVS.jpg) or [Uncanny Defense](https://i.imgur.com/unboeQ6.png) that remove a defender from the combat, but may still result in the defender occupying the row that Foom is attacking.  The ruling is that the defender removed by one of these cards is no longer part of the combat.

>The [Massive](https://i.imgur.com/e0WOynY.png) keyword does not combine with special attack declarations such as attacking a [Machine](https://i.imgur.com/Fg27kSk.jpg) or attacking a Location.

Attacking a machine is a special type of attack declaration that can only be done if all conditions are met. (No face up characters in the same row as the machine and the attacker can otherwise legally make an attack on that row.)  This was compared to attacking a location with the keyword on [The Thing That Crawls By Night](https://i.imgur.com/U3yOlXN.jpg).  Attacking a row with Massive is Foom's normal attack mode and does not combine with these special attack declarations.  That said, if Foom attacks a row with a Machine in it, he will simply not strike the Machine.  Foom can choose to make a single target attack on the machine if the other conditions are met allowing him to do so.  This is the same as the power on [The Thing That Crawls By Night](https://i.imgur.com/U3yOlXN.jpg) where if an SC were to gain both powers at once, they could not attack multiple Locations in a player's row.  They would need to either attack the front or back row with Massive or attack a Location with the keyword "Nothing is Too Big For it to Attack!"

# [Franklin Richards](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-021.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^FAN-021

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Franklin is one of the most powerful beings in the multiverse. So powerful he has been able to, from a young age, create a **Pocket Universe**. Here's what happens when he does that:

* Move each Character other than Franklin to the side of the playing space. **They are now in a separate part of the game.**
    * A **Pocket Universe** has only front and back rows (no resource row).  
    * When the characters are moved to the **Pocket Universe** they stay in the same rows they were in in the original universe. They keep all their counters and their orientation (ready/exhausted; face up/face down).  
    * The **Pocket Universe** is still in the same overall game as the original universe. So cards don't "appear" or "leave play" when they move from the original universe to the **Pocket Universe** or vice versa.  
    * Cards in the **Pocket Universe** cannot attack or otherwise affect cards in the original universe and vice versa.  
    * The Uniqueness rules don't apply across the **Pocket Universe** and original universe. (For example, you could have a Human Torch in both Universes.)  
    * Note: Your hand, deck, KO pile, and out-of-game piles can be accessed in both the original universe and the **Pocket Universe** (more on this below).  
* Each player who has characters in a **Pocket Universe** will take a separate turn in that **Pocket Universe** after their normal turn (before the next player's normal turn, and including the turn Franklin creates the **Pocket Universe**).  
    * First take your normal turn. During this turn, ignore the **Pocket Universe**.  
    * After your turn is over, you then take a **Pocket Universe** turn. During this turn, ignore the original universe.  
    * The cards you play on a particular turn can only affect that turn's universe.  
* A **Pocket Universe** turn sequence is a little different than a normal turn, as follows:  
    * Start of turn  
        * Note that there is no Draw Phase.  
    * Recovery Phase  
    * Formation Step  
        * Note that there is no Build Phase because there are no Recruit Points or resource rows in the **Pocket Universe**.  
    * Main Phase  
        * This works just like a "Normal" Main Phase in regard to combats.  
        * You can play Plot Twists from our hand to affect a **Pocket Universe**.
        * You can discard Locations from your hand to generate a power symbol in the **Pocket Universe**. (Since the **Pocket Universe** has no resource row, there are no locations to turn face down to generate a power symbol.)  
        * You can discard characters from your hand to Power Up characters in a **Pocket Universe**.
        * When a character is KO'd in a **Pocket Universe**, they go to the normal KO pile. Similarly, if a character leaves play due to an effect, it works the same as if the character were still in the original universe. For example, if an effect returned the character to its owner's hand, it would go to that hand as normal.
    * End of turn
* If there is more than one **Pocket Universe** in the game, each player will take their normal turn first, then a **Pocket Universe** turn for each **Pocket Universe** they have characters in, starting with the first **Pocket Universe** created, then the second, etc.
    * Cards in one **Pocket Universe** cannot attack or otherwise affect cards in another **Pocket Universe**.
* When Franklin leaves play, the characters from each **Pocket Universe** he created pop back into the original universe part of the game, in the same rows and with the same orientation they were in their **Pocket Universe**.
    * If this leads to more than one character with the same name on your side, KO all except one (your choice).

If a character with the chosen name gets put back into your deck somehow it will regain **Dimensional Wristwatch** while it's in your deck.

**Ticket to the Multiverse** lets Ghost-Spider jump from your game to a neighboring game. You must have permission from all players in that game before Ghost-Spider can make the jump into their game.

If no one else is playing near you or you don't have permission to move Ghost-Spider, then remove her from the game until the start of your next turn.

When Ghost-Spider enters another game or gets removed from the game set aside all her counters and Equipment. She will reappear in her original game with those counters and Equipment.

If Ghost-Spider enters anotehr game of Vs. System 2PCG, you decide which player gains control over her. She can attack, gain counters, get stunned, get KO'd, etc., just like in her original game. However, no matter what happens she will go back to her original game at the start of your next turn.

# Green Goblin
## [Green Goblin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-005.jpg) (MC - Sinister Six)
^CardNumber: ^CV1-005

*Set: Crossover*  

The Sinister Six have gained two new Main Characters to choose from. Remember, when you build a Sinister Six deck, you choose any six Sinister Six characters to go with that deck.

Goblin’s **Bag of Tricks** allows you to discard Locations to make him more powerful in combat. If this causes Goblin to strike “before each other character,” this means he strikes first even if any of the characters have, for example, a power like Ferocious. And if two Goblins are in combat with that ability, they’ll strike each other at the same time. If you discard an Oscorp Location, it’s like a wild: you can treat it as though it’s any of the other four Locations that you didn’t already discard this combat.

*Set: The Marvel Battles* 

Q: How does his **Sadistic Choice** power work?

A: First, you choose which character you want to stun. Then your opponent may discard a random card from their hand. If they can’t or choose not to, then that character gets stunned.

# [Grid](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MMU-053.jpg)
^CardNumber: ^MMU-053

*Set: Monsters Unleashed*

Q:  When **Magnetokinesis** moves an equipment from a character to another, do any limitations still apply? 

A: Even though the card just says to "move" the equipment, it still counts as being equipped to the new character. Therefore, any equipping restrictions on the equipment (such Ebony Blade can only be equipped to Black Panther or Black Knight) would still apply. 

---

Q: If you move Helmet of Immunity from one character on your side to another with Grid, would you choose a second power symbol and now it blocks both symbols from being used by enemy characters?

A: It does not leave play when it is unequipped. It is equipped to the new character and that will trigger the power which will allow you to choose. HOWEVER, the second part of the power refers to "THAT type" it is singular, it can only refer to the most recent choice. It can't refer to all prior choices made.

**La Fleur du Mal** lets you force your opponent to "pass" while in combat instead of playing a plot twist, using a super power, or powering up. For example, if Guillotine attacks a character, you could pass and then force your opponent to pass, which will cause the combat to resolve.

## [Hawkeye](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/COS-006.jpg) (MC - Illustrated)
^CardNumber: ^COS-006, ^COS-007

*Set: Cosmic Avengers*  

Hawkeye's **Custom Quiver** means he starts the game with his 4 different Custom Arrows Plot Twists set to the side. Once he's level 2, you may use **I Am the Weapon** to draw a random **Custom Arrows** card each turn. Once a custom Arrow card is in your hand, it acts just like a regular Plot Twist. Note that to be able to play any of them, Hawkeye must be face-up on your side, but for the Combat PlLot Twists he doesn't have to be in the combat himself (he can shoot really far). 

Please note that if you choose **Magnetic** on the **Utility Arrowheads** card, you *can* move the enemy equipment to an unequipped character on your side. Some of Hawkeye's **Custom Arrows** Have keywords and terms that aren't explained in full on them:

^CardNumber: ^MCU4-005, ^MCU4-006

*Set: Power & Reality*  

When you spend a power symbol from a Location in your resource row to put Hawkeye into a **Nest**, put the Location card partly underneath him and leave it face up as the **Nest**. (If you pay for the power by discarding a Location or you reduce the cost of the power to zero power symbols, nothing happens.)

While Hawkeye's **Nest** is one of the Locations named on his card, he has the associated text. 

While a Location is a **Nest**, it still counts as a Location as as being a face-up resource in your resource row, however it can't be used to generate a power symbol anymore. If the Location gets KO'd or leaves your side, the **Nest** effect ends. If the Location gets turned face down by an effect, put it back into your resource row and the **Nest** effect ends.

When Hawkeye gets stunned or leaves your side, turn the Location face down and put it into your resource row and the **Nest** effect ends.

If Hawkeye uses **I Want You On That Roof** while he already has a **Nest**, turn the old **Nest** faced own and put it into your resource row and this **Nest**effect ends.

Q: If I use the **Sow Distrust** power and my opponent's MC is stunned, does that mean I can choose any character in their hand?

A: Stunned characters keep their team affiliation so it doesn't matter if the MC is face up or stunned.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

Q: If I use **Sow Distrust** on my opponent and she has her MC removed from game (such as with Singularity), can I pick any card I want?

A: The effect is asking if a character in their hand matches the team affiliation of their MC. If the opponent does not have an MC at the time the effect resolves, then any character the player chooses, "will not share a team affiliation with that players main character." As he does not have one. Short of it, you can discard any character you like.

In most cases, his stats work like this. 1 ½ cost means you must pay 1 ½ recruit points to recruit him. So you will have ½ a recruit point left over. 4 ½ ATK means his strikes will stun a 4 DEF character but not a 5 DEF character. 3 ½ DEF means if he is struck with 3 ATK, he won't get stunned, but if he gets struck with 4 ATK he will get stunned. 2 ½ (Health) means 2 wounds won't KO him, but 3 wounds will.

If they pass, they're out of the **Battle of Wills**. Then the next player goes, and so on until all but one player passes. Then that player's character pays the winning number of power symbols from their resource row (no discarding from hand) and the Iso-Sphere is moved to that character (if it's not already there).

Q: Take this scenario: Jean Grey Omega MC Level 2. Owner has Dagger (HAMMER) on the board. Jean attacks, initiating her "Out of Control" power. Can Dagger convert those counters to +1 counters and still give Jean an XP?

A: Yes.

Replacement powers modify the things it says it replaces. In this case, Dagger changes the -1/-1 to +1/+1.

Straight from the compiled rules:

> Replacement Modifiers Replacement modifiers will change an existing modifier or event in order to produce a different result. This does NOT change the source of the original modifier or event, it just changes how it behaves. If two replacement modifiers are trying to change the same modifier or event, then the controller of the character being affected by the original modifier or event chooses the order. In some cases, once the first replacement modifier applies, the second one is no longer relevant. Replacement modifiers will usually begin with "If" and always contain the word, "instead."

Note the second sentence.

This does NOT change the source of the original modifier or event, it just changes how it behaves.

If Jenn is in your deck, you start the game with a **Wish** pile. When you make your deck, choose three different cards and put two copies of each of them into your **Wish** pile. There are a few rules (besides no wishing for more wishes):

- You can't choose Tokens.
- You can't choose Main Characters or Locations.
- You can't choose cards that start the game in piles (like Agendas) or cards that require a pile of their own.
- You **can** choose cards that couldn't start in your deck, like Illustrated Universe cards and other teams' Loyalty cards.
- You **can** choose copies of cards that are already in your deck, even if your deck already has the maximum number of those cards. 

During setup put your **Wish** pile out of play face down. Your Wish pile is private. (Your opponents can't look at it but you can look at it any time.)

When you make a Wish, remove both copies of any card in your Wish pile from the game, and choose an enemy player. **While those cards are removed this way, you may play one and that player may play one.**

# Juggernaut
## [Juggernaut](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BOM-001.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: ^BOM-001, ^BOM-002

*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*  

Juggernaut is so big and powerful it’s almost impossible to beat him physically. Fortunately (for his enemies) he’s vulnerable to other kinds of attacks. This is represented on his card by his **It’s Gonna Take Something More to Stop Me!** power, which allows enemy players to spend an ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy) to weaken him. Note: This works just like any other super power – except an enemy player can only use it once per turn during their Main Phase. And keep in mind special locations like Avengers Mansion can’t be used by an opponent on Juggernaut’s power.

## [Juggernaut](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-096.jpg) (SC)
^CardNumber: ^MNB-096

*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*

Q: How does his **Unstoppable** power work?

A: You make a solo attack with him against a front row character, then during combat you activate his power. If he stuns the defender and survives the combat, you may then immediately make another solo attack with him against a back row character controlled by the same player. Leave Juggernaut exhausted and dive right into his second combat. You can attack a back row character this way even if there are still face up front row characters.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

Q: If I use Enchantress' **Go Forth My Champion** on Juggernaut, and then activate **Unstoppable** on his first attack on a front row character, does he exhaust for his second **Unstoppable** attack?

A: In the case of Juggernaut it says to immediately attack a back row character, so the game jumps right back into combat. When "blah" is attacked/attacks triggers will still happen, but the normal rules for checking the legality if the attack (exhausting the attacker, making sure they are not protected etc.) do not apply. So in the case of Juggernaut + Enchantress it would work like this:  
  
* Use Enchantress's power on Juggernaut.  
* Juggernaut attacks a front row character and immediately readies.  
* Juggernaut uses his Unstoppable super power.  
* Juggernaut stuns the front row character and survives.  
* Juggernaut immediately attacks a back row character without exhausting.  
* Assuming Juggernaut survives the second combat he will still be ready.

Q: I attack with my Unstoppable Juggernaut. My opponent's front row character Plays Dead. Do I still get to trample through or no?

A: If you use Play Dead on a defender, the combat is over. Since Juggernaut did not stun the defender, his ability will not trigger.

# Kang

^CardNumber: ^FRI-006, ^FRI-007

*Set: The Frightful*

**Immeasurable Identities** makes all Kang Supporting Characters you own into Main Characters. This effect lasts the whole game, even if your starting Kang Main Character gets KO'd. And remember - as long as you have any Main Characters on your side, you don't lose the game.

^(Source: Rule Insert)

## [Kang](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FRI-009.jpg) (SC)
^CardNumber: ^FRI-009

*Set: The Frightful*

If any number of Kangs are in your deck, **The Tomorrow War** lets you pick a single **Future Date** before players draw their opening hands during setup. A **Future Date** is represented by a whole number from 1-10. It counts as being that "Date" while you have exactly that many resources.

So if you pick 7 as your **Future Date**, Kang can only appear while you have exactly seven resources. (On the bright side, he's free.) Note: If you forget to pick a **Future Date** at the beginning of the game, the game acts as though you chose 10 as the Date. 

**Time Will Tell** sets Kang's base ATK/DEF to be equal to the **Future Date** you selected. It doesn't matter how many resources you currently have. **Time Will Tell** "locks in" when you select the **Future Date** before the game starts.

^CardNumber: ^FUT-001, ^FUT-002

*Set: Futures Past*
Kate and Kitty have one name at Level 1 and then gain a new name at Level 2. In case it's not clear that Kate can Level UP into Kitty, the **AKA Shadowcat** can help.

For her **Future** power, you get the resources after you have mulliganed (or decided not to mulligan).

^(Source: Rule Insert)

---

Q: What if I use Singularity  to remove Kate Pryde from the battlefield. Does she still get XP from **Past**?

A: If multiple triggers occur at the same time, the turn player decides the order in which they resolve.
Powers only affect characters in play, and Level up powers are not an exception.

So, with Singularity, if you activated her power: both **Pocket Dimension** and **Past** activate at end of turn, and the active player decides in which order to resolve them.

If you resolve **Pocket Dimension** first, then Kate cannot gain the XP from **Past**, because she is not in play when it resolves.

Q: What if I use **Invisibility** to **Hide** Kate Pryde. Does she still get XP from **Past**?

A: In order for **Past** (her level up power) to trigger, Kate Pryde must be face-up and in play.

However the keyword **Invisibility** states:
> At the end of your turn, if this character is ready, you may hide it.

It is an End of Turn trigger like **Past**, so **Past** and **Invisibility** would both trigger at the same time. Even if **Invisibility** resolves first and hides Kate Pryde, the level up power **Past** has already triggered and will continue to resolve.

^CardNumber: ^DEF-028, ^DEF-029, ^LEG-046, ^LEG-047

*Set: Defenders*

Q: When I discard a Location card to use a Super Power does that give Kingpin an XP?

A: No, "appears" means to come into play from anywhere, so the Location has to be put into play. So playing one from your hand into your resource row or putting one into play from the top of your deck with Nick Fury would count. Discarding does not.

## [The Kingpin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-047.jpg) (SC)
^CardNumber: ^DEF-047

*Set: The Defenders*  

**Underworld Boss**  
The Kingpin Supporting Character has a Super Power where he takes over as your main character. When this happens, your former Main Character becomes a Supporting Character and remains in the game. It can still gain XP and Level Up, but you don’t lose the game if it gets KO’d. Instead, you now lose the game when Kingpin gets KO’d.

Q: If Kingpin (SC) becomes my Main Character will Groot (my former MC) still be able to level down? And if so will he sill get XP later on?

A: Groot retains his powers and Level Up ability, and **We Are Groot** is a Super Power that puts him back to Level 1, so yes.

Q: I control lvl2 Professor X and 2 Underworld supporting characters. I (until end of turn) gain control of your Kingpin SC. I activate Kingpin's super power and he becomes my main character. I end my turn and return control of your Kingpin SC (my MC). You could hypothetically KO my entire board and be unable to KO my main character. What rules are there dealing with this?

A: You lose the game. More specifically, at the beginning of your next turn if your opponent controls your MC, you lose the game.

Q: Can I steal an opponent's Kingpin with Purple Man after they've used **Underworld Boss** to make him their MC?

A: If Kingpin uses **Underworld Boss** and becomes the MC, he is no longer an SC and effects that require an SC can not be used or played on Kingpin. In short Purple Man can NOT steal Kingpin once he becomes a MC.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

Q: If I activate **Underworld Boss** while Elektra is in my hand, what happens to Elektra?

A: She is demoted to a Supporting character no matter what zone she is in. From the rules: "Some effects may promote a Supporting Character to Main Character and vice versa. Unlike most modifiers, these modifiers can apply to a Main Character in any zone (or side) and continue to apply to the character even if it changes zones."

**Spring the Trap**  
Kraven has a Reaction super power. These types of super powers work a little differently than normal super powers. Reaction powers trigger when a certain condition is met (in Kraven’s case, it’s “when an enemy supporting character appears”). When that happens you can pay a ![](%%Skill%%) (Skill), and if you do, you put three -1/-1 counters on that character. You can use a Reaction super power at any time, as long as its trigger condition is met. However, like other super powers, you can only use it once per turn.

Q: When does Death Strike determine if Lady Deathstrike has survived the Combat if I bring her into combat with an MC with Dramatic Entrance? If she isn't stunned by the Attacking MC and activated Death Strike will the MC get 2 wounds even though Dramatic Entrance will KO her at the end of combat?

A: To survive combat means to be unstunned at the conclusion of combat resolution; The survival check/combat resolution is distinctly before end of combat effects triggering. So yes, the MC will get 2 wounds.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

---

Q: How does Lady's Deathstrike's Death Strike ability interact with Luke Cage's Impervious skin? would he negate both wounds?

A: Impervious Skin would not apply because it only prevents wounds from getting stunned, it does NOT prevent wounds given another way. The wound given by Lady Deathstrike's Super Power is NOT from stunning, it is given directly by the resolving effect.

Legacy can pay for **Nega-Bands** by spending either a ![](%%Might%%) (Might) or Negative Zone Location.

*Set: Futures Past*

Here's how his **Canadian Resistance Colonel** works:

 - You can recruit characters from the three mutant teams face down (without revealing them), and if you do, they appear hidden (face down and ready) on your side, instead of face up.
 - While you still must pay normally for cards recruited this way (including any additional costs), you do not have to announce the recruit cost of the hidden cards you are recruiting.
 - For example, if you have 7 recruit points and you recruit a 3-cost and 4-cost character face down, you don't have to announce how much you paid for each one or how much you paid total. (However, you can't spend more recruit points than you have.)
    * You must also follow any other rules about recruiting, including any restrictions for when a character can appear, including uniqueness rules.
 - Hidden cards recruited this way mostly act like other hidden cards:
    * They aren't stunned, can't have Equipment or +1/+1 or -1/-1 counters, can't be attacked, and lose their powers.
    * They keep their names and team affiliations.
    * During your Recovery Phase, you must turn hidden cards on your side face up when you recover your stunned characters.
 - There are exceptions to cards recruited this way when compared to normal hidden cards.
	 * Only the cards' owner can look at them.
	 * They can make attacks while hidden on the turn appear:
		 * Cards with printed ![](%%Flight%%) and ![](%%Range%%) can make attacks while hidden as if they still had those powers.
		 * Remember, these cards keep their team affiliations, so they can make team attacks as normal, even with face-up characters.
		 * They don't exhaust when they attack.
		 * Right before they strike, turn them face up and exhaust them.

**Note:** Opponents will need to verify after cards recruited this way are turned face up that they were played within the rules, especially in regard to their costs.
