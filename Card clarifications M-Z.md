# [M41A Pulse Rifle](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/ALN-023.jpg)
*Set: The Alien Battles*

Q: Are equipment powers separate from character powers. Ex. Does Cosmo shut off the equipment on the character?

A: "The Equipment gives the character new powers and will stay with it until that character gets stunned or leaves play."    
Since the equipment is giving the powers to the character, it would be prevented or turned off by **Nullify**.

Q: Does activating the **M-40 Grenade** give Storm MC an XP?

A: "The Equipment gives the character new powers and will stay with it until that character gets stunned or leaves play."    
So the character has the power and the character is using it, so yes, this would count for Storm.

Q: If I want to use a wild location to pay for the Super Power granted by Equipment, which one do I need to use?

A: Since the character has the power, any wild location will need to match the character's team affiliation.

Q: Does using the **M-40 Grenade** ability count as that character causing the stun (if it stuns?)

A: When equipped the Character gains the abilities, so they are the ones doing them. If the -3/-3 stuns a character they would get credit. Also if they are looking for credit KOing a character and the -3/-3 KOs them, they get credit for the KO.

# [Mad Thinker](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-040.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

The Mad Thinker's **Computer Mind** is so powerful he can very accurately predict what his enemies are going to do. When you make a **Prediction**, secretly write down the name of two characters; an attacker and a defender. The names don't have to be characters in play at the time Mad Thinker uses the super power. When a character with the attacker's name attacks a character on your side with the defender's name (even in a team attack), cancel the combat. Then make another **Prediction** about the same turn, but this time you'll have a lot more data! You can make a maximum of two **Predictions** from each use of the super power.

# [Magik](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/NEW-014.jpg) 
*Set: New Mutants*  

Magik’s **Summon Soulsword** power introduces Equipment tokens to the game. An Equipment token works just like a regular Equipment while it’s in play. But if it ever leaves play, remove it from the game (the same way you would remove a character token).

*Set: Galactic Guardians*  

**Stationary** prevents Mainframe from moving even if an enemy player uses a push or pull effect on him or rearranges your formation.

**Primary Operating System**  
When Mainframe uses **Primary Operating System** it applies only to characters that are currently on your side. It doesn't apply to characters that appear on your side later that turn.

# [Magneto](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BOM-005.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*  

In this set Magneto gets a whole new main character card, and this time  it goes to Level 3. This card represents Magneto’s desire to bring all mutants together as one. (Note: The version of Magneto can’t level up into the version of him and vice versa. A main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork as it does.)

# [The Maker](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FRI-015.jpg)
*Set: The Frightful*

If the Maker is in your deck, you get to have the usual Invention pile, plus you can add up to five Equipment to it. They must be different cards (same name but different game text is fine) and can’t already have the Keyword  **Invention**. (You can also include copies of those Equipment in your deck if you like, and the copies in your Invention pile don’t count against them. For example, you can have a  **One of a Kind** Equipment in your deck and the same one in your Invention pile.)

**Note**: While the Maker (and only the Maker) can Invent those Equipment, you can still only play them if you meet their play requirements. For example, if the Maker invents a (Hydra) Cosmic Cube, you get to put it into your hand. But you still can’t play it unless you have a character with the Hydra team affiliation on your side.

# Mandarin
## [Mandarin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu1-046.jpg) (Photo)
*Set: The MCU Battles*  

Mandarin is really three potential characters in one. If Mandarin is in your deck you’ll need to bring your **Behind the Camera** pile with you which includes two copies of **Trevor Slattery** and one copy of **The Ten Rings**. When Mandarin gets KO’d, you’ll remove him from the game, shuffle your Behind the Camera pile, and randomly put one of the three cards there into your hand. 

This represents who Mandarin really is – lowly actor or deadly warlord. Leave the Behind the Camera pile face down – it’s important that your opponent doesn’t find out who the Mandarin really is until you’re ready to show them.

Q: Can I use a **Rebirth** power on the same turn I played a resource normally?

A: Yes. It’s essentially an extra resource.

Q: If a character with **Rebirth** gets KO’d by the Uniqueness rules (i.e. I play a second copy of Mantis) can I still use her Rebirth power?

A: Yes.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

Q: If an opponent steals my Mantis (using Professor X) and then she gets KO’d, who gets to use her **Rebirth** effect?

A: Whoever currently controls the card gets to choose whether to use the **Rebirth** effect. However, she can only be placed in the Resource Row of her owner. In the example, that will be you.

# Marvel Required (Equipment)
*Set: S.H.I.E.L.D. vs Hydra*   
 
This set includes four One of a Kind equipment cards – The Nullifier, Book of Vishanti, Darkhold, and Serpent Crown. Each of these has the (Marvel) symbol on its top right instead of a team affiliation. This means in order to play one, you must have a face-up (Marvel) character on your side.

# [Mastermind](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV2-014.jpg)
*Set: Crossover vol. 2*  

When Mastermind appears, you'll create a Tactics pile made of any number of other Masterminds you have in your deck and hand. (Note: You don't have to put every Mastermind from your hand and/or deck into your Tactics pile.) Tactics piles are public. When Mastermind gets attacked, you mach choose to play a random card from your Tactics pile. If you do, follow the instructions under its Tactic. Then put the card into your KO pile. When Mastermind leaves play, you'll leave your Tactics pile where it is. A player can only have one Tactics pile at a time. Later, if Mastermind appears on your side again, and you can (and want to) add more Tactics from your hand or deck, add them to your existing Tactics pile. Note: One of Mastermind's Tactics sets an attacker's ATK to 0 this combat. That character can still gain ATK later in the combat.

# [Match](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-013.jpg)
*Set: The Utopia Battles*

Q: If Match strikes a Defender does he *only* put -1 counters on someone, or does he do counters *and* strike simultaneously?

A: When he strikes a Defender, his strike *is* the -1/-1 counters. These aren't applied, however, until the combat is resolved. So, let's say that his opponent is 4/4 and is in position to strike back. Both Match and the Defender would strike simultaneously. The Defender hits with 4/4, Match hits with his counters (which haven't yet resolved). Match would be stunned by the strike back, and then the Defender would be reduced to 0/0 with the counters and would also be stunned.

---

Q: Match's ability says, "If Match would strike a defender, put -1/-1 counters equal to his ATK on that defender instead." Does that mean this ability only applies when Match is attacking? (Not when he is striking back as a defender.)

A: Correct.

# [Mattie Franklin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/WEB-011.jpg)
*Set: Webheads*  

If Mattie is in your deck you can bring a Gift pile, which must include one of each of the five Gifts: Death, Immortality, Knowledge, Madness, and Power. When Mattie uses **The Gathering of Five** choose five different characters on  your side with different names. At least one of these characters must be one of your Main Characters. Then randomly assign one of the five Gifts to each of them. If you don't have at least five characters on your side with different names (or you don't have a Main Character on your side), Mattie can't use **The Gathering of Five**.

The Gift of Death will instantly KO its assigned character. The other four grant new abilities to their assigned characters (some good, some bad). Gift cards are not actually in play. Their cards are just play aids to remind everyone what new abilities each character has gained. If a character leaves play its Gift will no longer affect them (even if that character reenters play).

Q: If you use Medusa's **Prehensile Hair** ability can that character be removed with Singularity? I know it says can't be moved but I am not sure if that just refers to front of back row.

A: "Can't be moved" only applies to effects that use the words move, pull, push and switch.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

Q: Can a defending character locked down by Medusa be replaced in the combat & moved with Uncanny Defense or Spiderman MC?

A: The Defender will be replaced with a new defender but the switching of places is defined as a move so they will both stay where they are because if one of the characters can't move for a switch, neither will.

# [Mephisto](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-053.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

At your own risk, you may offer a **Deal with the Devil**. Here's how it works:

* The **Deal** must involve at least two elements.  
    * For example, the offer can't be "I draw ten cards."  
* There can only be one offer for the **Deal** - this is a "take it or leave it" situation.  
    * Mephisto hates negotiation.  
* The **Deal** can only involve game effects.  
    * For example, you can't offer money.  
* The **Deal** must be able to resolve immediately.  
    * Nothing that affects later turns or games.  
* All parts of the **Deal** must resolved simultaneously.  

Here are a few exemplar **Deals**:  

 -  "I draw five cards an you draw ten cards."  
 - "Wound your main character and put a supporting character from your hand onto your side."  
 - "You choose a character on your side and a character on my side and we stun them both."  
 - "I discard my hand and you lose the game."

# [Might Makes Right](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-016.jpg)
*Set: Black Order*  

In this Arc, we are playing around with how players can use locations besides super powers. In addition to cards like Nebula (who has a keyword power which requires spending a ![](%%Might%%) (Might), each Issue will have a Plot Twist and Special Location that allow their main characters to have some pretty powerful effects on the game. A few things about these Plot Twists and Special Locations.

* They are not super powers.  
* Your main characters must be face up to pay for them.  
* Your main characters can use a "Wild" Special Location from their team to pay for them.  
* These cards are neutral, so just like any other neutral cards, they can be in Loyalty decks.  
* The Special Locations don't count as location swith a specific power symbol (for powers like Black Widow Main Character's Level Up power **Red in Her Ledger** or ZZutak's **Paint to Life**).

*Set: H.A.M.M.E.R.*  

[This card has received significant errata.](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rulings#wiki_mimic)

---

Previously the Absorption History pile included any three main characters with different names. Going forward, his Absorption History pile may only include the original five X-Men plus Professor X. This change reduces the number of main characters Mimic can copy, which avoids overpowered interactions. It also brings Mimic more in line with his classic flavor. This change is effective October 1st, 2020.

Below are the updated rules. (This replaces the rules entry in the H.A.M.M.E.R. Issue rules insert.) The changes are underlined.

---

**Mimic**

Mimic’s Absorption History, from his **Checkered Past** Keyword,  represents three characters that he’s copied powers from. In game terms it’s a pile that includes exactly three Main Character cards, one Level 1, one Level 2, and one Level 3. They can only be from the Illustrated Universe,  they must be Marvel and they must have three different card titles from the following list:

-   Angel
-   Beast
-   Cyclops
-   Iceman
-   Jean Grey
-   Professor X

Note: There is no main character with the card title Beast. Yet.

“Card title” refers to the name at the top of the card. It does not include additional names granted via  **AKA**.

At the time of this writing (September 2020), your choices at each level are:

Level 1: Angel, Cyclops (2 options), Iceman, Jean Grey, Professor X (2 options)

Level 2: Cyclops (2 options), Iceman, Jean Grey, Professor X (2 options)

Level 3: Jean Grey, Professor X

**Note:** While Mimic  _can_  copy Professor X’s Level 3  **Graduation**  super power, he won’t actually be able to  **Graduate**  any X-Men. (This is because the Graduation super power requires a Graduation pile, and you only get to bring a Graduation pile if Professor X is your main character, not if Professor X’s power is being copied. Look for an upcoming rules update that clarifies how out-of-game piles work.)

During setup when you reveal Mimic as your Main Character, you’ll also reveal the Level 1 character in your Absorption History. Mimic gains its Keyword and Super Powers only when the game begins.

When Mimic becomes Level 2, you’ll reveal the Level 2 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Power and loses the powers of the Level 1 character he was previously copying.

When Mimic becomes Level 3, you’ll reveal the Level 3 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Powers and loses the powers of the Level 2 character he was previously copying.

**Note:**  While  **Checkered Past** is a Keyword and can technically be turned off by certain effects, turning it off doesn’t affect Mimic’s ability to use the pile (it’s locked in from the beginning of the game).

Q: When using whichever lvl character from the **Absorption History** pile, which team affiliation does one use: Mimic's (H.A.M.M.E.R.) or the absorption power character's team?  

A: Mimic gains their powers, not team affiliations. Mimic is H.A.M.M.E.R. - it doesn't matter what his absorb guy is for any reason. That card isn't even technically in play.

# [Mirage](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/NEW-010.jpg)
*Set: New Mutants*   

Mirage’s **Create Illusion** power lets you put a basic location from your hand into your resource row. Note that the new resource won’t generate any recruit points on the turn it appears. This is because recruit points are only generated at the start of your Recruit Step, which happens before you can recruit characters like Mirage.

# [Mole Man](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-033.jpg) (MC)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

Mole Man can **Tunnel** beneath enemy resources. If there are any enemy Locations, he must tunnel under those first. If there are none, he can tunnel under a face-down resource. When he **Tunnels**, remove him from the game and place him beneath the card he is tunneling under. At the start of your next turn, put him back onto your side and if the card he was under was a Location, turn it face down. If it was already face down, KO it.

If he is beneath a Location and it gets turned face down (including by being used for a super power) or leaves play, put him into your back row. If he is beneath a face-down resource and it leaves play, put him into your back row.

# Moloid
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*

Q: Which side does Moloid check to determine the ATK boost?

A: Though it's not totally clear, "that" refers to the opponent against whom you were attacking. So if you had 3 face down resources and your opponent had 5, Moloid would get +5 ATK when it attacked.

# [Monarch](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/OGA-013.jpg)
*Set: The Omegas*  

**Pull On Quantum Strings** means you can have Equipment, characters, and Plot Twists (non-locations) face up in your resource row and during your Resource Step you can play a non-location face up as a resource. Characters on your side can use these non-locations to pay for their Super Power, regardless of their required power symbols. 

Example: You have Monarch and the X-men Cyclops Supporting Character on  your side. Cyclops can use any of the non-locations face up in your resource row to pay for his **Battle Tactics** Super Power. He can still use School for Gifted Youngsters and Training Grounds to pay for the Battle Tactics normally.

These non-locations can't be used for any other purpose.

When Monarch leaves your side, or if **Pull On Quantum Strings** gets turned off, turn each face up non-location card in your resource row face down.

Treat it as a regular attack (both players can play Plot Twists, Power-Up, etc.), but keep in mind the face-down character’s powers are turned off and its Team Affiliation is not available for things like playing a Plot Twist. 

When Mr. Black and the defender strike each other:  
* Mr. Black can get stunned as normal.  
* A hidden character can get stunned as normal. (Wound it and change its orientation from ready to exhausted.)  
* If Mr. Black’s strike would stun an already-stunned character, wound it instead. Note: A stunned character can’t be stunned (including by having its DEF reduced to 0 or a direct “stun” effect).

Q: If she is lvl 1 and has one -1/-1 counter on her and attacks lvl2 She-Hulk (6/6) and uses **Masquerade**, does she gain +6 ATK and +6 XP?

A: Yes, you clever Monkey.

^(Source: FB Community Post)

Q: Ok, what if she has three -1/-1 counters on her, giving her basically -2 Attack and she gains +4 ATK making her have 2 ATK; does she gain 4 XP or 2 XP?

A: 4 XP . From the rule book: ATK values that are below 0 are treated as 0 except when trying to raise or lower them. In the latter case, always use the real value.

Q: Does adding counters count as her gaining ATK? What about Trickster God switching her ATK/DEF, would she gain 5 xp as she turns into a 6/1?

Q: Mystique and Green Goblin are out; Mystique attacks and uses her power to give her 4 ATK and she has enough to level up. Does she keep those 3 ATK she took from green goblin to make her a 9/7?

A: Yes. The vast majority of the time, the results of a resolving effect are "locked in" at resolution and even if the situation later changes, the modifier still applies. The only exception is if they use the word "While" which mean it is continuously looking for a specific variable to be true or false.  
  
Since this does not use "While" we know it is locked in at resolution. As long as the duration has not expired, any modifier affecting the Lvl 1 Mystique will continue to affect the Lvl 2 Mystique.  
  
In the example given by the OP, the +3 ATK gained by her Super Power would continue to apply after she is level 2.

Q: With **Masquerade**, Does Mystique gain that character’s base ATK, or their current attack including counters/modifiers/etc?

For example, if Spider Ham attacks Mystique while Madame Web is in his side, giving him 8/4, and Mystique uses masquerade, does she gain attack up to 6 (since this is spider ham’s base ATK) or does she gain attack up to 8 (since he has +2/+2 from madame web)? So would she gain 5 XP or  7 XP?

A: Mystique matches power including all modifiers, so she’d gain 7 attack. It would say “printed attack” if it worked the other way.

With **The Perfect Metamorph**, you may choose a face-down character. If the chosen character would get stunned by  **The Perfect Metamorph**  but it’s already stunned, nothing else happens. (Neither it nor Mystique get stunned.) If the chosen character is no longer in play when Mystique would be stunned, Mystique gets stunned normally.

Keep in mind, the effect from  **The Perfect Metamorph**  lasts until Mystique gets stunned. If it allows her to avoid getting stunned, the effect remains active. In other words, a single use of the power could prevent several stuns to Mystique.

Even if  **The Perfect Metamorph**  is active, Mystique can use it again to change her name and affiliations, and to have a different enemy character become her new potential stun replacement.

Note: If Mystique takes the name of a unique character with the same name as a supporting character on your side, that supporting character will get KO’d.

Q: After I use her **Impersonate** power to copy someone’s ATK and DEF, what happens if that character’s ATK or DEF change?

A: Nothing. Mystique locks in whatever that character’s current ATK and DEF are as her Base ATK and DEF for the turn. If they change later it doesn’t affect her.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

Q: What happens if Mystique has any +1/+1 counters when I use Impersonate?

A: Apply the +1/+1s after her stats change. For example, let’s say she has two +1/+1 counters and she Impersonate’s a 4/7 character. She’ll become 4/7 with two +1/+1 counters for an end result of 6/9.

* They are not super powers.  
* Your main characters must be face up to pay for them. (But it doesn't have to be in the combat to pay for Nova Corps.)  
* Your main characters can use a "Wild" Special Location from their team to pay for them.

> The Nullifier's effect can be Nullified by effects that turn off keyword powers and if it changes sides it will target the updated "enemy characters" as the affected target(s).

This was clarified in July 2019 that many people were playing this card incorrectly. We originally believed this card to work in a way that made Nullifier's effect independent of the card itself, so it could not be Nullified. Essentially that the effect and targets would be unchanged until the card left the play zone, even if it swapped sides or got targeted by Cosmo or another Nullifier.

^(Source: UDE official clarification)

> The Nullifier only affect powers that resolve in the play zone.

This was clarified in July 2019 that the Nullifier will have no effects on powers that resolve before they appear such as Dark Phoenix SC who has a "When you recruit Dark Phoenix" trigger. Recruiting happens before appearing so it cannot be stopped with the Nullifier. This is also true of cards that have effects that will resolve from your hand such as Shadowcat SC's Intagible Escape. You can still name a power that is not in play yet, but Nullifier will only act upon that power once the card is in play and some effects will resolve before that point.

^(Source: UDE official clarification)

---

To explain the above differently:

First, the Nullifier does two things: A triggered power when it appears (you name a thing); then, a continuous power that keeps the named thing turned off.

Because this is now classified as a continuous modifier it means that it will impact characters played after the Nullifier entered play.

It also means that the Nullifier can now be Nullified. Cosmo or an opposing Nullifier can now Nullify the continuous modifier. It also means that when Grid steals a Nullifier it continues to work, targeting *enemy* characters. This turns the Nullifier against the player who played it.

A: If he is removed from the game and comes back, he is a 0/0 with 0 health. The Modifier created by **Joint Consciousness** can not track him between zones, so once he leaves play, it no longer applies. When he comes back into play, **Joint Consciousness** will not trigger.

# Pixie

## [Pixie](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-008.jpg) (MC)
*Set: The Utopia Battles*  

**Souldagger** causes a character to lose each modifier it gained during combat. A modifier is an effect that modifies the game. There are two types of modifiers – 

A one-shot modifier does something immediately and then is done. Example: “Put two +1/+1 counters on a character.”

 A continuous modifier has an ongoing effect on the game, which may or may not have a duration. Example: “Choose a character to get +2/+0 and **Lethal** this combat.” 
 
When Pixie uses **Souldagger**, it will cause an enemy character to lose any continuous modifiers that are applying to it. (It won’t stop any one-shot modifiers because it’s impossible for there to be any one-shot modifiers happening while you use **Souldagger**.) 

**Half-Fairy** will give Pixie an XP when any character (including an enemy) pays an ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy). This includes when a character uses an ![](%%Energy%%) (Engergy) Super Power, or choosing to spend an ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy) when you play the Plot Twist **Sacred Ground**.

You can also use the Gem to turn cards in play face down. If you do this to a ready character, it counts as hiding it. If you do it to an exhausted character, it counts as dazing it (i.e. stun it but it doesn't gain a wound). 

If you do it to an equipment, that equipment will stay equipped but its powers are temporarily turned off. It will turn face up again when the characters on that side would recover. If you do it to a location or face-up Infinity Gem, it will turn face down.

**Headlong Charge**  
Rhino “Sidestep” means that the defender stays where it is, but avoids Rhino just enough. The defender doesn’t count as moving. When an enemy front row character sidesteps, you’ll get to pick a new defender in their back row. If there aren’t any, the combat will end. Sorry Rhino!

However, an effect could move her from one player's front row to another player's front row.

**Pusher** affects the next enemy player's Formation Step. You can either force that player to put their Range characters into their front row or their characters without Range into their back row.

**Note:** You must choose which option you want when you use **Pusher**, not during the enemy player's Formation Step.

When **Kitsunegari** moves an enemy character to your side, you may immediately have it use one of its **Main** Super Powers without paying its power symbols. Then whether it used one of its powers or not, it goes back to the same row and position it was in. If it used one of its powers, then it won't be able to use that power again this turn.

Q: If Rogue KO's Madame Masque, can I power up Rogue and put the discarded Rogue into play?

A: Yes, Rogue's Absorb Power gains all of Madam's powers and replaces all instances of Madam's Name with her own, so she gains this power. The second copy of Rogue in play is not KO'd because the first copy also absorbed the **Swarm** power.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

Q: Ok, so now I have two Rogues in play (via Madame Masque as mentioned above); if the first one with **Swarm** is Stunned does she lose **Swarm** and do I lose the second copy to uniqueness?

A: While the stunning itself would NOT remove **Swarm**, that is not relevant here. The modifier that gives Rogue **Swarm** has a duration that only lasts UNTIL she is stunned. So when she is stunned, the modifier stops giving her **Swarm**, and you will need to apply the uniqueness rule if relevant.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

Q: Alright, so what if the first Rogue with **Swarm** gets Nullified by Cosmo, doesn't she lose **Absorb** which would in turn make her lose **Swarm**?

A: **Swarm** is still there as nothing can remove **Swarm**. **Absorb** is now gone so she can not "absorb" any new powers, but any previously created modifiers (like the one giving her **Swarm**) are still there.

# Scarlet Spider
## [Scarlet Spider](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SPF-003.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Spider-Friends*  

Before he was the Scarlet Spider, the man who would become Ben Reilly was created from Peter Parker’s DNA to be a perfect clone. So in the game he actually starts off as a different “Spider” hero until his true self is revealed (once he reaches Level 2). Here’s how it works: 

Your Spider Web is a new out-of-play pile that includes up to one copy of every other Level 1 main character with “Spider” in its name. (Currently this includes Spider-Man from The Marvel Battles expansion, \* Spider-Man \* from Monsters Unleashed, and Spider-Man and Spider-Woman from this Issue.) 

Your Clone Pile is another out-of-play pile. It starts empty but during the game you’ll put characters from your Spider Web into it. 

Before the game begins, when each player reveals their main character, you’ll reveal the Scarlet Spider. Then instead of putting him on your side during setup, you’ll put a character from your Spider Web onto your side. 

When that character would become Level 2, you’ll instead transform it into Level 2 Scarlet Spider. (It will keep its counters, any effects on it, and its ready/exhausted and face-up/facedown orientation.) Then put the Level 1 main character he started the game as and the Level 1 Scarlet Spider main character into your Clone Pile. 

Once he’s Level 2, if he would be wounded, there’s a chance it was just a clone body instead: reveal a random card from your Clone Pile. If you reveal Scarlet Spider, he’ll get wounded as normal – they found you! But if you reveal someone else, he doesn’t get wounded (although whoever was revealed goes back into your Spider Web.)

Q: What happens to the MC when Singularity takes them out the game while being **Hex**ed by Scarlet Witch?

# [Secret Hideout](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SFO-016.jpg)
*Set: Spidey-Foes*  

**Family is a Source of Weakness** lets your (Sinister Syndicate) Main Character take a **Hostage**. If you have any Secret Hideouts in your deck, you must bring a Hostage pile, which includes one ore more *different* (Spider-Friends) Supporting Characters with the **Friends and Family** keyword.

When you play Secret Hideout, one of your Main Characters takes a **Hostage**. Choose a character from your Hostage pile and put it beneath the Secret Hideout as a **Hostage**. Your Main Character gets the Keyword Power granted by that Hostage *while that Main Character is in your front row*.

For example, if you take Mary Jane hostage, your Main Character will gain **Pounce** while it's in  your front row. (It doesn't have to be protecting anyone.)

When that Main character gets stunned or leaves play, turn the Secret Hideout face down and set the **Hostage** aside. (It doesn't go back to your Hostage pile.) Similarly, if an effect turns the Secret Hideout face down, set the **Hostage** aside. Once the **Hostage** card is no longer beneath the Secret Hideout it also stops granting its Keyword Power.

It's possible for the same Main Character to have multiple Hostages (one for each Secret Hideout you play while you have that Main Character). 

Note: A **Hostage** is never actually in play. It's either in a Hostage pile, beneath a Secret Hideout, or set aside (after leaving a Secret Hideout).

**Rules Lawyer**  
She-Hulk’s main character introduces a new kind of super power called a **Reaction**. It reads:

Reaction powers trigger when a certain condition is met (in this case it’s “When an enemy player uses a super power”). When that happens you can pay an (and say “Objection” of course) and if you do it cancels the super power so it never takes effect.

You can use a Reaction power at any time, as long as its trigger condition is met. However, like other super powers, you can only use it once per turn.

Q: How does **Rules Lawyer** work timing wise under the rules for effects needing to resolve as soon as they are played?

A: Basically when She-Hulk LV2 is in play, whenever an opponent uses a Super Power, they will need to give the She-Hulk player a chance to respond before resolving the effect.

Q: What happens if I use Singularity's power to remove my characters, then on my opponent's turn, Singularity is targeted by Cosmo. Do my characters still return at the end of the turn or when singularity is stunned/leaves play?

Removing the power from the source does nothing to negate or change the delayed trigger modifier already created.

Q: Juggernaut attacks Singularity who is in the front row, pays a ![](%%Might%%) (Might) and stuns her. Do the other characters come back in time for Juggernaut to declare his second attack or no?

A:  The controller of Singularity decides which row the characters come back into play. So they could put them in the front row, or the back row. So if they opt to put them all in the front row, it is no dice. If they put at least one in the back row, the next question then becomes, can Juggernaut attack them? And the answer is YES! You see, Singularity triggers upon her leaving play which is during combat resolution, so that is when her power triggers. Juggernaut on the other hand, triggers after combat resolution is over. Since Singularity triggered first, it will resolve first and your opponent could opt to put a character into his back row. IF he does, then it will be there for Juggernaut to attack when his trigger resolves.

Q: If you use Play Dead on Singularity do the removed cards stay removed or enter play?

A: The characters stay removed from game, until Singularity is removed from play or the start of the Singularity Player's next turn.

Q: Does a frozen character thaw out if they get flickered by Singularity?

A: Yes, most modifers do not track characters that leave play. The only ones that do will specically say they do either in the rules or in the card text.

# Sister Grimm
## [Sister Grimm](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/aff-006.jpg) (MC)
*Set: A-Force*

Q: The Singularity ruling states that when a character comes back into play it is a new character and nothing has now previously effected it. Can Sister Grimm use a **...Let the Staff of One Emerge** ability she has previously used since technically she's a new character and now has not technically used the previous ability?

A: A once per game restriction is something that functions in all zones, no matter who controls the character or what zone it is in. This means even if a character with a power with a once per game restriction leaves play and comes back, you still can not use it again if it was used before leaving play. Also if an opponent takes control of a character with a one per game restriction, if they use the super power, when you get it back, you will not be able to use that power.

Q: What if two players are playing Sister Grimm? say if one uses bounce house first can the other player **Bounce House**?

*Set: Spider-Friends*  

**I Can and Will Fight You**
This issue introduces the powerful Alien Symbiote version of Spider-Man. But as they say, with great alien power comes great alien… danger. While the symbiote does make him stronger, he must remove it or it will quickly be game over. In the comics, when Spider-Man fights off the symbiote, it splits off from him as a separate entity. In the game, when Spider-Man sheds the symbiote, it splits off from him as a separate card. When this happens, Spider-Man will become Level 2 and now wears a cloth version of his black costume and the Alien Symbiote will look for a new host. (Note: Spider-Man Level 2 has one less Health – this represents losing the strength of the symbiote.) 

When a character with the Alien Symbiote is turned face down but isn’t KO’d, just keep the equipment token face up and ready, just like when it’s equipped to a face-up character (it doesn’t exhaust or turn face down). And remember, the symbiote is a jealous entity – it can’t be destroyed or removed from its host (at least until the host leaves play).

When **Tony's Tinkering** lets Spider-Man download an **Update**, put an **Update** counter on him. (You can use a coin, bead, slip of paper, or an XP counter to keep track of Spidey's **Updates**). When Spidey installs **Updates**, you may remove any number of **Update** counters from him.

If you remove exactly one **Update** he gains (Flight) and (Range) until he leaves play. If you remove exactly two **Updates**, put two vitality counters on him. If you remove exactly three **Updates**, put twelve +1/+1 counters on him.

You can remove the same number of **Updates** more than once. For example, if you remove the two **Updates** for a second time, Spider-Man will get two more vitality counters.

Note: **Update** counters aren't removed from Spidey when he gets turned face down. However, they are still removed when he leaves play.

This Spider-Man, from the Ultimate Universe, is our first character to share a mantle with two other people! (Miles Morales and the main Marvel Universe's Peter Parker.) In this comics, this Peter died... but then came back to life because the **Oz Formula** that gave him his powers also granted him immortality. For the game, this means when Peter is KO'd, you won't lose the game immediately for not having a main character. You'll have until the end of your next turn to bring him back when a Supporting Character with the **Friends and Family** keyword appears on your side. In this case, put him back onto your side with wounds equal to his (Health) minus 1. (With the **Oz Formula** mechanic, Peter can continue fighting for those he cares about.)

He can also split up his strikes if he's in combat with multiple enemies (such as if he's being team attacked).

# \* [Star Lord](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-006.jpg) \*
*Set: Galactic Guardians*  

Kitty Pryde becomes Star-Lord when the original Star-Lord is otherwise employed. So she has *s around her name, meaning she shares the "mantle" with Star-Lord, himself. The sharing of the mantle means both characters can be on a side at the same time because they're different beings, just with the same name. So you don't KO either because of the uniqueness rules and they can't power each other up.

Note that although this card represents her joining the Guardians of the Galaxy she's still an X-Men at heart, so she has both team affiliations.

Her **Intangibility** power lets her strike characters while they're in a player's hand. This is uncanny. A couple things about this: 

* She can strike any number of 0 DEF characters (or characters with * DEF).  
* She can strike characters who normally couldn't be struck by her while on a side (like Bulletproof characters) because those powers aren't active while the character is in a hand.  
* It doesn't matter how much (Health) a struck character has, it gets discarded.

>Supreme Leader's effect will prevent you from losing the game and will also prevent other players from winning the game

Supreme Leader MC is worded in a way that may make veterans of other card games such as Magic the Gathering believe that a card like [Dutch SC](https://i.imgur.com/N3EzGfJ.jpg) or [Deadpool MC](https://i.imgur.com/3Qt4DfF.png) may still allow an alternate win condition.  After all, in MtG a player being unable to lose doesn't prevent another player from winning as they are isolated effects.  In VS 2PCG this is considered an extension of the "can't beats can" rule.  By that logic, alternate win conditions are ignored as long as Supreme Leader is preventing its controller from losing the game.

Q: What happens if I recruit Taskmaster while my opponent has Onslaught in play?

A: So Onslaught's Power happens at the time you recruit him (faster than appears powers).  
  
Taskmaster comes into play, but doesn't have Onslaught's power when he's recruited, so nothing happens.  
  
As far as the power's that Onslaught has, Taskmaster doesn't copy those because they aren't Printed Powers like Taskmaster is looking for.  
  
So Onslaught is effectively doing nothing for Taskmaster.

> Keyword abilities are only in effect while the character card is in play unless otherwise specified.

Previous to [Taskmaster's](https://i.imgur.com/85KjJHT.jpg) release, keyword abilities were active in all zones.  This allowed cards such as [Hope Summers](https://i.imgur.com/R2iOAee.png) to use their powers from the hand, deck or KO pile.  With the release of Taskmaster, this rule became limiting on design of future cards and was changed.  (For example, Taskmaster was able to be recruited from the deck with [Spider-Gwen's](https://i.imgur.com/ZkdbqZ0.png) Dimensional Watch keyword if your opponent had her in play.)

>A copied power can't copy a power with the same name as itself.

An infinite loop was discovered when [Taskmaster](https://i.imgur.com/85KjJHT.jpg) was across from an opposing Taskmaster where they would gain a copy of, then continuously copy the printed version of their opponent's Photgraphic Reflexes.  With this additional rule, this scenario would result in Taskmaster gaining two instances of all keyword powers for face-up enemy supporting characters, but the loop would not continue beyond two instances.

At Level 1, if Thanos gets KO'd by getting stunned, **Resurrected by Death Herself** will cause him to gain an XP and become Level 2 while in the stunned position. (If a power like Hex prevents him from leveling up, he'll remain at Level 1 but still heal his wounds.)

**Schemes and Dreams**  prevents you from drawing cards during your Draw Phase, including your normal draws plus effects like Genius. However, if Thanos is face down at the start of your turn, Schemes and Dreams will be turned off. This means you can draw cards during your Draw Phase, however you can't search for a card.

**My Quest Begins** counts each card that enters your hand from your deck. So if you draw three cards, that would be 3 XP.
  
**The Universe Will Now Be Set Right**  has a 50-50 chance of removing each character on each side from the game. If this removes a players last main character, that player ;oses the game.

A: When you play it switch the character’s current stats. Any new stat changes will work as normal off those switched stats. For example, let’s say you have a 4/7. When you play Trickster God it becomes a 7/4. Then if you give it +3 DEF it becomes a 7/7.

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

**The Watcher** sees everywhere; including but not limited to enemy decks (shuffle them afterwards) hands, face-down resources, cards removed from the game and out of game piles (even if they're secret). 

**The Doer** *does* remove the effects of the **Freeze** keyword.

# [Ultron](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu1-040.jpg) (MC)
*Set: The MCU Battles*  

**Ultron Facility**  
Ultron is really six main characters in one: three identical Level 1s, two identical Level 2s, and one Level 3. Before the game starts you’ll put one Level 1 Ultron onto your side. The remaining five Ultron cards will start out of play in a face-up pile called your **Ultron Facility**. 

During the game you can use any Ultron’s **There’s Only One Path To Peace** power to put the lowest level Ultron from your Ultron Facility onto your side. When one of your Ultron main 27 characters gets KO’d it goes back to your Ultron Facility where it will be available to be brought back again.

If all your Ultrons are in the Ultron Facility at the same time, you lose the game. 

**Note:** The Level 3 Ultron’s **Your Extinction** power KOs all enemy cards (in a very dramatic way).

# [Uncanny Defenses](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-051.jpg)
*Set: The Marvel Battles*

Q: Can I switch the defender with a stunned character on my side?

A: No. You can only replace a defender with a face-up character. (Stunned characters can’t enter combat.)

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

Q: Can I play it if I don’t have a valid character to replace the defender?

A: Yes, but nothing will happen.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

---

Q: What happens if I make a ranged attack and my opponent plays a Plot Twist to switch the defender to a character with **Dodge**?

A: Once an attack starts, it can no longer be made illegal. So that attack will continue as normal.

# [Valkyrie](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-020.jpg)
*Set: The Defenders*

Q: Do you still have to spend resource points to recruit after activating Valkyrie's **Chooser of the Slain**?

A: Yes. Valerie doesn't allow you to play from KO pile for free. It specifically says you can recruit from KO pile which means you would have to pay recruit cost to play the character from KO pile.

# Venom
## [Venom](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/CV1-010.jpg) (MC - Sinister Six)
*Set: Crossover*  

The Sinister Six have gained two new Main Characters to choose from. Remember, when you build a **Sinister Six** deck, you choose any six Sinister Six characters to go with that deck.

Venom’s **Relentless Bond** will put a +1/+1 counter on him whether or not he’s stunned.

^(Source: Rule insert)

## [Venom](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-031.jpg) (MC - Underworld)

Q: Does removing -1/-1 counters from Venom (via power up, Fair and Balanced, etc) count towards his Growing Bond level up ability?

A: The ways you mentioned do not "remove -1/-1" they add +1/+1 counters to a character. It is only after they are added that the rules of the game will then remove +1/+1 counters and -1/-1 counters until only one kind remain or none. So yes, they will trigger Venom's level up power.

# [Weapon Omega](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-035.jpg) (MC) 
*Set: The Utopia Battles*  

**Mutant Energy Absorption**’s effect has no duration. So a character that loses and can’t gain powers this way, will remain like that until it leaves play. 

**Addicted to Mutant Energy** affects a character as it appears, which means it won’t even trigger any of its powers that occur when it appears. It also has no duration, so a character affected by it will remain affected until that character leaves play.

# [Willie Lumpkin](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-010.jpg)

Willie is a **Delivery Expert**, not a Delivery Novice. Package counters stay on Willie even if he's turned face down.

Also, Willie *can* deliver a Package to a Baxter Building in Wyatt Wingfoot's part of the resource row. He's that good!

# [Willow](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-023.jpg) (SC) 
*Set: The Buffy Battles*  

Willow’s **Spell Research** power puts Plot Twists into a special pile removed from the game called your Spellbook. Your Spellbook can’t have more than one copy of the same Plot Twist. 

**Spellcasting**  
Her Spellcasting power lets you play Plot Twists from your Spellbook, putting them into your KO pile when they resolve. 

If Willow gets KO’d or otherwise is no longer on your side, you won’t be able to access the Plot Twists in your Spellbook. But if you play another copy of Willow, then you can use your Spellbook again.

# [Winter Soldier](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-033.jpg) (MC)
*Set: The Defenders* 

> Winter Soldier MC will not gain experience if he can't "Freeze"

A commonly asked interaction on the Winter Soldier MC is whether or not you can use an effect like X-Factor to ready him the same turn he has frozen himself, then gain another XP.  The final ruling is that the Freeze effect is a cost that must be paid to gain the XP and a Frozen character cannot Freeze again.  Winter Soldier must wait until he is no longer Frozen (normally two turns after gaining the first XP) before he is eligible to Freeze again and gain the second XP.

Q: Can Winter Solider team attack to Level Up?

A: Yes, Winter Soldier gets credit for stunning a character in a team attack.

Q: Does Winter Soldier gain an XP if he is stunned while stunning a defender?

A: Yes.

Q: Does a frozen character thaw out if they get sent to a **Pocket Dimension** by Singularity? Can this circumvent MC Winter Soldier's drawback?

A: Modifiers do not track characters that leave play unless the rules or card text specifically says they do.

# [The Wizard](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-037.jpg) (MC)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

**Wizard Armor**  
Here are the four Plot Twists he has at his disposal:

**Open Fire**  
(Any Combat): Choose an attacker to get +2/+0 this combat.

**Find Cover**  
(Any Combat): Choose a defender to get +0/+3 this combat.

**Savage Surprise**  
(Any Combat): Choose a defender to get +4/+0 this combat.

**Best Offense is a Good Defense**  
(Any Combat): Choose an attacker to get +0/+5 this combat.


^(Source: Rule insert)

---

**Wizard Armor**  reads:

>While the Wizard is in combat, you may play any plot twist as a copy of an Open Fire, Find Cover, Savage Surprise, or Best Offense is A Good Defense plot twist.

When you use **Wizard Armor,** ignore everything about the plot twist you’re holding and play it entirely as an Open Fire, Find Cover, etc.

If the plot twist has a play restriction you can’t meet (for example a team affiliation symbol you don’t have on your side) it doesn’t matter.

Similarly, if a Plot Twist has a play benefit (like Death Trap) you don’t get to make use of it.

The Wizard Main Character is found in the Vs. System 2PCG: The Fantastic Battles set.

# [Wolverine](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-029.jpg) (MC)
*Set: The Marvel Battles*

Q: If Wolverine team attacks with one other character, but in the middle of combat the other character gets stunned by a Plot Twist or Super Power, and then Wolverine stuns the defender, will Wolverine get an XP because now it ended up being a solo attack?

A: Yes, because it only checks if it was a solo attack during combat resolution.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

Q: If Wolverine is stunned as an enemy character is stunned as the result of striking each other, will Wolverine get an XP?

A: Yes.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

Q: Scenario: Wolverine level 2 has 4 wounds and 1 XP. He attacks and trades with a defender. Question: Does wolverine take his 5th wound and get KO'd or can he get the XP and level up first (gaining a 6th health).

A: There is a difference between a stunned Wolverine leveling up while stunned and a stunned Wolverine leveling up before he is KO'ed. While technically the level-up power will trigger, by the time it resolves, Wolverine is already KO'ed.

# [Wyatt Wingfoot](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-014.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

**Self-Awareness**  
Wyatt knows he is in a  **Card Game**, and he wants to play too! So when he appears, and until he leaves play, he gets his own hand and resource row.  **Note:** His hand counts as being part of your hand, and his resource row counts as being part of your resource row.

Here’s how it works:

*   At the end of your Draw Phase, Wyatt draws two cards into his part of your hand. (Keep these cards separate from the main part of your hand.)  
    *   **This is the only way to add cards to his part of your hand**. If another effect would add cards to your hand, they always go to the main part of your hand, never to Wyatt’s part of your hand.  
    *  All other effects that affect your hand work as normal.  
        *   For example, if you are forced to ”discard a random card”, you must randomize all the cards in your hand, including Wyatt’s part of your hand.  
* At the end of your Resource Step, Wyatt may play a resource from his hand into his part of your resource row. (Keep these resources separate from the main part of your resource row.)
    *   **This is the only way to add resources to his part of your resource row**. If another effect would add resources to your resource row, they always go to the main part of your resource row, never to Wyatt’s part of your resource row.  
* At the end of your Recruit Step (after you’ve spent your normal Recruit Points to play cards from the main part of your hand, and any leftover Recruit Points go away), you gain 1 Recruit Point for each resource in Wyatt’s part of the resource row. You can only spend these Recruit Points to play cards from Wyatt’s part of your hand.  
* Characters and Equipment you play from Wyatt’s part of the hand work as normal once they are on your side. (Once they’re in play, it doesn’t matter if they came from your main hand or Wyatt’s part of your hand.)  
* You can play Plot Twists or power-ups from Wyatt’s part of your hand as normal.  
* You can spend Locations in Wyatt’s part of your resource row or discard them from Wyatt’s hand to generate power symbols normally.  
* When Wyatt leaves play, remove the cards in his part of your hand and resource row from the game. (Characters and Equipment played from his part of your hand stay in play.)

**Note:** If Wyatt gets moved to another player’s side, remove all the cards in his part of your hand and resource row from the game. Now Wyatt will draw extra cards and play extra resources for that player.

X-23 is one of the toughest mutants around. So tough in fact that she only has a Level 1 main character. She can’t level up and she doesn’t care.

# [Xander](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-015.jpg) (SC) 
*Set: The Buffy Battles*  

When Xander hides, turn him face down but in the ready orientation. Remove all +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters and Equipment from him. A hidden character doesn’t count as being stunned, but it still can’t attack or defend, it doesn’t protect anyone behind it, and loses its powers. It still keeps its other information like name and team affiliation. If a hidden character gets stunned somehow, change it to the stunned orientation (face down and exhausted). A hidden character will turn face up the same time your stunned characters would recover.

# [The X-Files](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-021.jpg)
*Set: The X-Files Battles*

This Location is the only way to generate an Earth power symbol for a Bureau character. There are currently no basic Earth Locations in the Photographic Universe.
