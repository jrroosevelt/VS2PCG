^CardNumber: ALN-023

*Set: The Alien Battles*

Q: Are equipment powers separate from character powers. Ex. Does Cosmo shut off the equipment on the character?

A: "The Equipment gives the character new powers and will stay with it until that character gets stunned or leaves play."    
Since the equipment is giving the powers to the character, it would be prevented or turned off by **Nullify**.

Q: Does activating the **M-40 Grenade** give Storm MC an XP?

A: "The Equipment gives the character new powers and will stay with it until that character gets stunned or leaves play."    
So the character has the power and the character is using it, so yes, this would count for Storm.

Q: If I want to use a wild location to pay for the Super Power granted by Equipment, which one do I need to use?

A: Since the character has the power, any wild location will need to match the character's team affiliation.

Q: Does using the **M-40 Grenade** ability count as that character causing the stun (if it stuns?)

A: When equipped the Character gains the abilities, so they are the ones doing them. If the -3/-3 stuns a character they would get credit. Also if they are looking for credit KOing a character and the -3/-3 KOs them, they get credit for the KO.

# [Mad Thinker](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-040.jpg)
^CardNumber: FAN-040

*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

The Mad Thinker's **Computer Mind** is so powerful he can very accurately predict what his enemies are going to do. When you make a **Prediction**, secretly write down the name of two characters; an attacker and a defender. The names don't have to be characters in play at the time Mad Thinker uses the super power. When a character with the attacker's name attacks a character on your side with the defender's name (even in a team attack), cancel the combat. Then make another **Prediction** about the same turn, but this time you'll have a lot more data! You can make a maximum of two **Predictions** from each use of the super power.

A: Magneto does KO equipment owned by the enemy (such as Inhibitor Collars played by the enemy).

# [The Maker](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FRI-015.jpg)
^CardNumber: FRI-015

*Set: The Frightful*

If the Maker is in your deck, you get to have the usual Invention pile, plus you can add up to five Equipment to it. They must be different cards (same name but different game text is fine) and can’t already have the Keyword  **Invention**. (You can also include copies of those Equipment in your deck if you like, and the copies in your Invention pile don’t count against them. For example, you can have a  **One of a Kind** Equipment in your deck and the same one in your Invention pile.)

**Note**: While the Maker (and only the Maker) can Invent those Equipment, you can still only play them if you meet their play requirements. For example, if the Maker invents a (Hydra) Cosmic Cube, you get to put it into your hand. But you still can’t play it unless you have a character with the Hydra team affiliation on your side.

*Set: The MCU Battles*  

Mandarin is really three potential characters in one. If Mandarin is in your deck you’ll need to bring your **Behind the Camera** pile with you which includes two copies of **Trevor Slattery** and one copy of **The Ten Rings**. When Mandarin gets KO’d, you’ll remove him from the game, shuffle your Behind the Camera pile, and randomly put one of the three cards there into your hand. 

This represents who Mandarin really is – lowly actor or deadly warlord. Leave the Behind the Camera pile face down – it’s important that your opponent doesn’t find out who the Mandarin really is until you’re ready to show them.

Q: If an opponent steals my Mantis (using Professor X) and then she gets KO’d, who gets to use her **Rebirth** effect?

When Mastermind appears, you'll create a Tactics pile made of any number of other Masterminds you have in your deck and hand. (Note: You don't have to put every Mastermind from your hand and/or deck into your Tactics pile.) Tactics piles are public. When Mastermind gets attacked, you mach choose to play a random card from your Tactics pile. If you do, follow the instructions under its Tactic. Then put the card into your KO pile. When Mastermind leaves play, you'll leave your Tactics pile where it is. A player can only have one Tactics pile at a time. Later, if Mastermind appears on your side again, and you can (and want to) add more Tactics from your hand or deck, add them to your existing Tactics pile. Note: One of Mastermind's Tactics sets an attacker's ATK to 0 this combat. That character can still gain ATK later in the combat.

^CardNumber: TUB-013

*Set: The Utopia Battles*

Q: If Match strikes a Defender does he *only* put -1 counters on someone, or does he do counters *and* strike simultaneously?

A: When he strikes a Defender, his strike *is* the -1/-1 counters. These are applied during combat resolution. So, let's say that his opponent is 4/4 and is in position to strike back. Both Match and the Defender would strike simultaneously. The Defender hits with 4/4, Match hits with his counters (which haven't yet resolved). Match would be stunned by the strike back, and then the Defender would be reduced to 0/0 with the counters and would also be stunned.

Q: Match's ability says, "If Match would strike a defender, put -1/-1 counters equal to his ATK on that defender instead." Does that mean this ability only applies when Match is attacking? (Not when he is striking back as a defender.)

A: Correct.

If Mattie is in your deck you can bring a Gift pile, which must include one of each of the five Gifts: Death, Immortality, Knowledge, Madness, and Power. When Mattie uses **The Gathering of Five** choose five different characters on  your side with different names. At least one of these characters must be one of your Main Characters. Then randomly assign one of the five Gifts to each of them. If you don't have at least five characters on your side with different names (or you don't have a Main Character on your side), Mattie can't use **The Gathering of Five**.

The Gift of Death will instantly KO its assigned character. The other four grant new abilities to their assigned characters (some good, some bad). Gift cards are not actually in play. Their cards are just play aids to remind everyone what new abilities each character has gained. If a character leaves play its Gift will no longer affect them (even if that character reenters play).

Q: Can a defending character locked down by Medusa be replaced in the combat & moved with Uncanny Defense or Spiderman MC?

At your own risk, you may offer a **Deal with the Devil**. Here's how it works:

* The **Deal** must involve at least two elements.  
    * For example, the offer can't be "I draw ten cards."  
* There can only be one offer for the **Deal** - this is a "take it or leave it" situation.  
    * Mephisto hates negotiation.  
* The **Deal** can only involve game effects.  
    * For example, you can't offer money.  
* The **Deal** must be able to resolve immediately.  
    * Nothing that affects later turns or games.  
* All parts of the **Deal** must resolved simultaneously.  

Here are a few exemplar **Deals**:  

 -  "I draw five cards an you draw ten cards."  
 - "Wound your main character and put a supporting character from your hand onto your side."  
 - "You choose a character on your side and a character on my side and we stun them both."

A few things about these Plot Twists and Special Locations.

* They are not super powers.  
* Your main characters must be face up to pay for them.  
* Your main characters can use a "Wild" Special Location from their team to pay for them.  
* These cards are neutral, so just like any other neutral cards, they can be in Loyalty decks.

[This card has received significant errata.](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/rulings#wiki_mimic)

---

Previously the Absorption History pile included any three main characters with different names. Going forward, his Absorption History pile may only include the original five X-Men plus Professor X. This change reduces the number of main characters Mimic can copy, which avoids overpowered interactions. It also brings Mimic more in line with his classic flavor. This change is effective October 1st, 2020.

Below are the updated rules. (This replaces the rules entry in the H.A.M.M.E.R. Issue rules insert.) The changes are underlined.

---

**Mimic**

Mimic’s Absorption History, from his **Checkered Past** Keyword,  represents three characters that he’s copied powers from. In game terms it’s a pile that includes exactly three Main Character cards, one Level 1, one Level 2, and one Level 3. They can only be from the Illustrated Universe,  they must be Marvel and they must have three different card titles from the following list:

-   Angel
-   Beast
-   Cyclops
-   Iceman
-   Jean Grey
-   Professor X

Note: There is no main character with the card title Beast. Yet.

“Card title” refers to the name at the top of the card. It does not include additional names granted via  **AKA**.

At the time of this writing (September 2020), your choices at each level are:

Level 1: Angel, Cyclops (2 options), Iceman, Jean Grey, Professor X (2 options)

Level 2: Cyclops (2 options), Iceman, Jean Grey, Professor X (2 options)

Level 3: Jean Grey, Professor X

**Note:** While Mimic  _can_  copy Professor X’s Level 3  **Graduation**  super power, he won’t actually be able to  **Graduate**  any X-Men. (This is because the Graduation super power requires a Graduation pile, and you only get to bring a Graduation pile if Professor X is your main character, not if Professor X’s power is being copied. Look for an upcoming rules update that clarifies how out-of-game piles work.)

During setup when you reveal Mimic as your Main Character, you’ll also reveal the Level 1 character in your Absorption History. Mimic gains its Keyword and Super Powers only when the game begins.

When Mimic becomes Level 2, you’ll reveal the Level 2 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Power and loses the powers of the Level 1 character he was previously copying.

When Mimic becomes Level 3, you’ll reveal the Level 3 character in your Absorption History. Mimic now gains its Keyword and Super Powers and loses the powers of the Level 2 character he was previously copying.

**Note:**  While  **Checkered Past** is a Keyword and can technically be turned off by certain effects, turning it off doesn’t affect Mimic’s ability to use the pile (it’s locked in from the beginning of the game).

Q: When using whichever lvl character from the **Absorption History** pile, which team affiliation does one use: Mimic's (H.A.M.M.E.R.) or the absorption power character's team?  

A: Mimic gains their powers, not team affiliations. Mimic is H.A.M.M.E.R. - it doesn't matter what his absorb guy is for any reason. That card isn't even technically in play.

At the start of your next turn, put him back onto your side and if the card he was under was a Location, turn it face down. If it was already face down, KO it.

**Pull On Quantum Strings** means you can have Equipment, characters, and Plot Twists (non-locations) face up in your resource row and during your Resource Step you can play a non-location face up as a resource. Characters on your side can use these non-locations to pay for their Super Power, regardless of their required power symbols. 

Example: You have Monarch and the X-men Cyclops Supporting Character on  your side. Cyclops can use any of the non-locations face up in your resource row to pay for his **Battle Tactics** Super Power. He can still use School for Gifted Youngsters and Training Grounds to pay for the Battle Tactics normally.

These non-locations can't be used for any other purpose.

^CardNumber: PRD-007, PRD-008

*Set: The Predator Battles*  

**Enhanced Bio-Mask** 
Mr. Black’s super power allows him to attack a face-down (hidden or stunned) character. Treat it as a regular attack (both players can play Plot Twists, Power-Up, etc.), but keep in mind the face-down character’s powers are turned off and its Team Affiliation is not available for things like playing a Plot Twist. 

When Mr. Black and the defender strike each other:  
* Mr. Black can get stunned as normal.  
* A hidden character can get stunned as normal. (Wound it and change its orientation from ready to exhausted.)  
* If Mr. Black’s strike would stun an already-stunned character, wound it instead. Note: A stunned character can’t be stunned (including by having its DEF reduced to 0 or a direct “stun” effect).

*Set: Legacy*  

**Identity Theft**  
Mystique’s super power allows her to transform into a different Level 2 Main Character. When she does this, remove her from the game and put the new character into play in the same orientation (ready/exhausted) she was in. Move all counters from her onto the new character, applying any effects (such as Freeze) to the new character. 

Playing with friends, you can choose to transform into any character in your collection, but if you’re playing in a tournament, you must select three Main Character options when you build your deck. You must set them face-down next to your unused Level 2/Level 3 characters. (You don’t need to show them to your opponent.)

A: Yes, you clever Monkey.

Q: Ok, what if she has three -1/-1 counters on her, giving her basically -2 Attack and she gains +4 ATK making her have 2 ATK; does she gain 4 XP or 2 XP?

A: 4 XP . From the rule book: ATK values that are below 0 are treated as 0 except when trying to raise or lower them. In the latter case, always use the real value.

^(Source: FB Post - Kirk)

Q: Does adding counters count as her gaining ATK? What about Trickster God switching her ATK/DEF, would she gain 5 xp as she turns into a 6/1?

Q: Mystique and Green Goblin are out; Mystique attacks and uses her power to give her 4 ATK and she has enough to level up. Does she keep those 3 ATK she took from green goblin to make her a 9/7?

A: Yes. The vast majority of the time, the results of a resolving effect are "locked in" at resolution and even if the situation later changes, the modifier still applies. The only exception is if they use the word "While" which mean it is continuously looking for a specific variable to be true or false.  
  
Since this does not use "While" we know it is locked in at resolution. As long as the duration has not expired, any modifier affecting the Lvl 1 Mystique will continue to affect the Lvl 2 Mystique.  
  
In the example given by the OP, the +3 ATK gained by her Super Power would continue to apply after she is level 2.

Q: With **Masquerade**, Does Mystique gain that character’s base ATK, or their current attack including counters/modifiers/etc?

For example, if Spider Ham attacks Mystique while Madame Web is in his side, giving him 8/4, and Mystique uses masquerade, does she gain attack up to 6 (since this is spider ham’s base ATK) or does she gain attack up to 8 (since he has +2/+2 from madame web)? So would she gain 5 XP or  7 XP?

A: Mystique matches power including all modifiers, so she’d gain 7 attack. It would say “printed attack” if it worked the other way.

With **The Perfect Metamorph**, you may choose a face-down character. If the chosen character would get stunned by  **The Perfect Metamorph**  but it’s already stunned, nothing else happens. (Neither it nor Mystique get stunned.) If the chosen character is no longer in play when Mystique would be stunned, Mystique gets stunned normally.

Keep in mind, the effect from  **The Perfect Metamorph**  lasts until Mystique gets stunned. If it allows her to avoid getting stunned, the effect remains active. In other words, a single use of the power could prevent several stuns to Mystique.

Even if  **The Perfect Metamorph**  is active, Mystique can use it again to change her name and affiliations, and to have a different enemy character become her new potential stun replacement.

Note: If Mystique takes the name of a unique character with the same name as a supporting character on your side, that supporting character will get KO’d.

Q: What happens if Mystique has any +1/+1 counters when I use Impersonate?

A: Apply the +1/+1s after her stats change. For example, let’s say she has two +1/+1 counters and she Impersonate’s a 4/7 character. She’ll become 4/7 with two +1/+1 counters for an end result of 6/9.

> The Nullifier's effect can be Nullified by effects that turn off keyword powers and if it changes sides it will target the updated "enemy characters" as the affected target(s).

This was clarified in July 2019 that many people were playing this card incorrectly. We originally believed this card to work in a way that made Nullifier's effect independent of the card itself, so it could not be Nullified. Essentially that the effect and targets would be unchanged until the card left the play zone, even if it swapped sides or got targeted by Cosmo or another Nullifier.

^(Source: UDE official clarification)


---

> The Nullifier only affect powers that resolve in the play zone.

This was clarified in July 2019 that the Nullifier will have no effects on powers that resolve before they appear such as Dark Phoenix SC who has a "When you recruit Dark Phoenix" trigger. Recruiting happens before appearing so it cannot be stopped with the Nullifier. This is also true of cards that have effects that will resolve from your hand such as Shadowcat SC's Intagible Escape. You can still name a power that is not in play yet, but Nullifier will only act upon that power once the card is in play and some effects will resolve before that point.

^(Source: UDE official clarification)

---

To explain the above differently:

First, the Nullifier does two things: A triggered power when it appears (you name a thing); then, a continuous power that keeps the named thing turned off.

Because this is now classified as a continuous modifier it means that it will impact characters played after the Nullifier entered play.

It also means that the Nullifier can now be Nullified. Cosmo or an opposing Nullifier can now Nullify the continuous modifier. It also means that when Grid steals a Nullifier it continues to work, targeting *enemy* characters. This turns the Nullifier against the player who played it.

*Set: Space & Time*  

Odin introduces **Level Down Powers** to the game. A Level Down Power works just like a Level Up Power, except instead of gaining XP which advances it to a higher level, it gains XP which regresses it back to a lower level. When a character gains Level Down XP, put an XP counter on its Main character card that is one level lower than its current level. If a character has both a Level Up and a Level Down Power, it's possible for it to gain and have both kinds of XP. However, once it levels up or levels down, all of both types of XP will be removed.

Here's an example of how Odin works:

Odin actually starts off as his most powerful self at Level 1. but after a few turns of gaining power through **The Odinforce** (or other means) he'll level up and then take a nap. While he's asleep he can gain both Level Down XP and Level Up XP. If he gets two Level Down XP, he'll wake up and level down back to Level 1, and both kinds of his XP will be removed. But if he gets two Level Up XP instead, he'll level up to Level 3 and realize his time has come.

*Set: MCU heroes*  

**They Need Someone to Avenge**  
Phil’s They Need Someone to Avenge power is not optional. If he’s in your KO pile at the start of your Main Phase, you must remove him from the game and then you can put +1/+1 counters on your characters.

# Pixie

## [Pixie](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TUB-008.jpg) (MC)
^CardNumber: TUB-008, TUB-009

*Set: The Utopia Battles*  

**Souldagger** causes a character to lose each modifier it gained during combat. A modifier is an effect that modifies the game. There are two types of modifiers – 

A one-shot modifier does something immediately and then is done. Example: “Put two +1/+1 counters on a character.”

 A continuous modifier has an ongoing effect on the game, which may or may not have a duration. Example: “Choose a character to get +2/+0 and **Lethal** this combat.” 
 
When Pixie uses **Souldagger**, it will cause an enemy character to lose any continuous modifiers that are applying to it. (It won’t stop any one-shot modifiers because it’s impossible for there to be any one-shot modifiers happening while you use **Souldagger**.) 

**Half-Fairy** will give Pixie an XP when any character (including an enemy) pays an ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy). This includes when a character uses an ![](%%Energy%%) (Engergy) Super Power, or choosing to spend an ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy) when you play the Plot Twist **Sacred Ground**.

* Use a location to recover and ready Adam Warlock

Does Adam Warlock get KO'd??

A: Pixie's effect becomes independent of Pixie once it brings Adam into play. So if Adam is in play at End of Turn, he will be KO'ed.

# [Power Man](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/DFX-017.jpg)
^CardNumber: MCU2-013

*Set: The New Defenders*  

Some characters are known by more than one moniker - like Power Man, who says **AKA Luke Cage**. He counts as having both names, which means you can use a Luke Cage supporting character to Power Up Power Man, and vice versa. It also means they both count as the same person for the purposes of the Uniqueness rules.

Power Man loves a good party, especially if he wasn’t invited. His **Crash the Party** power counts each enemy power, even if there are multiple instances of the same power. But remember face-down characters lose their powers so he won’t count their powers.

# Professor X
## [Professor X](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mnb-033.jpg) (MC - The Marvel Battles)

Q: If Prof X MC uses **Mental Domination** to take control of Sister Grimm MC and suicides her, does she level up?

A: The default point of reference is always the controller. The controller in this case is the Professor X player. And it is during his turn and if he suicides Sister Grimm MC, it is NOT the "enemy's turn."

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel)

---

Q: Can I steal a Main Character with **Mental Domination**?

A: Yes. You control that character for the whole turn as though it were your own. If it gets stunned, it takes a wound as normal. If that wound would KO it, it gets KO’d as normal and that player is out of the game. It can even gain XP and level up, but we would recommend against doing that for your opponent.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

Q: If I stun an enemy without attacking (like with Gambit’s **Kinetic Card Throw**), will I still get the XP from **A Dream of Peace**?

A: Yes.

^(Source: UDE FAQ)

## [Professor X](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/NEW-005.jpg) (MC - New Mutants)
*Set: New Mutants*  

In this set the Professor gets a whole new main character, and this time he goes up to Level 3. (Note: This new Professor X can’t level up into the old one from The Marvel Battles set and vice versa. A main character can only level up into a main character from the same set or into one that has the same artwork as it does.) 

Professor X’s **Graduation** power lets you turn an (X-Men) supporting character into the main character version of that character. (Once it’s become a main character it can level up normally. Professor X is a really good teacher.)

This allows you to have any number of main characters in play at once. However, Professor X is still your MAIN main character – if he gets KO’d you’ll lose the game. (Your other main characters getting KO’d won’t cause you to lose the game.)

# [Proteus](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/OGA-014.jpg)
*Set: The Omegas*  

Proteus is technically a Supporting Character but he doesn't want to actually be in play. He prefers to have a physical host. If he would be recruited, you'll remove him from the game instead and choose a face-up character on your side to be his Host. If you don't have a face-up character, Proteus will still be removed from the game. When his Host gets stunned or leaves play Proteus will no longer have a Host, but he does remain removed from the game.

If Proteus would appear any other way except by being recruited, he will be stunned and KO'd because he has zero DEF.

^(Source: Rule insert)

---
Scenario: An enemy character is Proteus' host. I recruit Dark Phoenix and remove Keywords from the game.

Q: Does the +10/+10 remain on the character because Proteus' **Reality Warping** has been already activated and now Proteus is no longer in the game?

A: Reality Warping is a Keyword that grants a Super Power. If Dark Phoenix calls Keywords the entire Keyword is removed including the Super Power ability. If Dark Phoenix calls Super Powers only the Super Power ability of Reality Warping is removed. (Mark from Upper Deck)

Said another way, since a keyword granted all these powers and boosts, if keyword text is removed as a concept then it is like the keyword never existed in the first place.

*Set: The Defenders*

Q: If I'm ranged team attacking with Punisher and Star-Lord, can I activate **Perfect Position** and choose to have the ranged defender strike back at Punisher? Hereby avoiding the damage?

A: Yes. This also works with Namor team attacking alongside a Leader against a back row character.

# Punisher 2099
*Set: Crossover Vol. 3*

Q: If I power up Punisher 2099 with multiple copies in a single attack, does each power-up add another wound?

A: Yes. Each copy of Punisher 2099 that is used to power up grants an additional wound. So if you powered him up with two copies, it would grant two additional wounds; three total - one for the attack and two for the two copies discarded to power up.

# [Purple Man](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/def-045.jpg)

Q: How does Cosmo interact with a Purple Man that has already stolen a character in the turn it came into play?

A: Once Purple man's power has been activated and resolved, it is independent of its source. Cosmo removing his power after the fact has no effect on a modifier from a previously resolved power.

*Set: Brotherhood of Mutants*  

Pyro’s **Fire Manipulation** power lets him create a supporting character creature that has the stats of a random character from your deck. The new character uses a physical supporting character card but erases its name, team affiliation, and game text and powers and replaces them with the name Fire Man, the (Brotherhood) team symbol, and the Creature keyword. (Which means it can’t have equipment.) When it’s KO’d or otherwise leaves play the card will go back to counting as the character printed on it.

**Increased metabolism and Improved Thermal Homeostasis** lets you have multiple Quicksilver characters in play at once.

# [The Reality Gem](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-020.jpg)
*Set: Black Order*  

You can use this Gem to turn cards in play face up. If you choose a stunned character this counts as recovering it. If you choose a hidden character, it counts as un-hiding it. If you choose a face-down location, it will turn face up. If you choose any other type of face-down resource (including an Infinity Gem), it will remain face down. (It should be revealed to each player to prove that it's not a location). 

You can also use the Gem to turn cards in play face down. If you do this to a ready character, it counts as hiding it. If you do it to an exhausted character, it counts as dazing it (i.e. stun it but it doesn't gain a wound). 

If you do it to an equipment, that equipment will stay equipped but its powers are temporarily turned off. It will turn face up again when the characters on that side would recover. If you do it to a location or face-up Infinity Gem, it will turn face down.

**Headlong Charge**  
Rhino “Sidestep” means that the defender stays where it is, but avoids Rhino just enough. The defender doesn’t count as moving. When an enemy front row character sidesteps, you’ll get to pick a new defender in their back row. If there aren’t any, the combat will end. Sorry Rhino!

# [Roberta](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/HER-010.jpg)

**Receptionist** prevents Roberta from leaving the front row.

However, an effect could move her from one player's front row to another player's front row.

# [Robert Patrick Modell (MC)](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-048.jpg)

**Note:** You must choose which option you want when you use **Pusher**, not during the enemy player's Formation Step.

When **Kitsunegari** moves an enemy character to your side, you may immediately have it use one of its **Main** Super Powers without paying its power symbols. Then whether it used one of its powers or not, it goes back to the same row and position it was in. If it used one of its powers, then it won't be able to use that power again this turn.

A: Yes. **Lethal** is no longer a trigger. It changes the wound given in combat to a lethal wound. Since this is a KO by combat, all team attackers get credit for the KO, including Rogue.

Q: If Rogue KO's Madame Masque, can I power up Rogue and put the discarded Rogue into play?

A: Yes, Rogue's Absorb Power gains all of Madam's powers and replaces all instances of Madam's Name with her own, so she gains this power. The second copy of Rogue in play is not KO'd because the first copy also absorbed the **Swarm** power.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

Q: Ok, so now I have two Rogues in play (via Madame Masque as mentioned above); if the first one with **Swarm** is Stunned does she lose **Swarm** and do I lose the second copy to uniqueness?

A: While the stunning itself would NOT remove **Swarm**, that is not relevant here. The modifier that gives Rogue **Swarm** has a duration that only lasts UNTIL she is stunned. So when she is stunned, the modifier stops giving her **Swarm**, and you will need to apply the uniqueness rule if relevant.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

Q: Alright, so what if the first Rogue with **Swarm** gets Nullified by Cosmo, doesn't she lose **Absorb** which would in turn make her lose **Swarm**?

A: **Swarm** is still there as nothing can remove **Swarm**. **Absorb** is now gone so she can not "absorb" any new powers, but any previously created modifiers (like the one giving her **Swarm**) are still there.

# Scarlet Spider
## [Scarlet Spider](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/SPF-003.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Spider-Friends*  

Before he was the Scarlet Spider, the man who would become Ben Reilly was created from Peter Parker’s DNA to be a perfect clone. So in the game he actually starts off as a different “Spider” hero until his true self is revealed (once he reaches Level 2). Here’s how it works: 

Your Spider Web is a new out-of-play pile that includes up to one copy of every other Level 1 main character with “Spider” in its name. (Currently this includes Spider-Man from The Marvel Battles expansion, \* Spider-Man \* from Monsters Unleashed, and Spider-Man and Spider-Woman from this Issue.) 

Your Clone Pile is another out-of-play pile. It starts empty but during the game you’ll put characters from your Spider Web into it. 

Before the game begins, when each player reveals their main character, you’ll reveal the Scarlet Spider. Then instead of putting him on your side during setup, you’ll put a character from your Spider Web onto your side. 

When that character would become Level 2, you’ll instead transform it into Level 2 Scarlet Spider. (It will keep its counters, any effects on it, and its ready/exhausted and face-up/facedown orientation.) Then put the Level 1 main character he started the game as and the Level 1 Scarlet Spider main character into your Clone Pile. 

Once he’s Level 2, if he would be wounded, there’s a chance it was just a clone body instead: reveal a random card from your Clone Pile. If you reveal Scarlet Spider, he’ll get wounded as normal – they found you! But if you reveal someone else, he doesn’t get wounded (although whoever was revealed goes back into your Spider Web.)

Q: What happens to the MC when Singularity takes them out the game while being **Hex**ed by Scarlet Witch?

**Family is a Source of Weakness** lets your (Sinister Syndicate) Main Character take a **Hostage**. If you have any Secret Hideouts in your deck, you must bring a Hostage pile, which includes one ore more *different* (Spider-Friends) Supporting Characters with the **Friends and Family** keyword.

When you play Secret Hideout, one of your Main Characters takes a **Hostage**. Choose a character from your Hostage pile and put it beneath the Secret Hideout as a **Hostage**. Your Main Character gets the Keyword Power granted by that Hostage *while that Main Character is in your front row*.

For example, if you take Mary Jane hostage, your Main Character will gain **Pounce** while it's in  your front row. (It doesn't have to be protecting anyone.)

When that Main character gets stunned or leaves play, turn the Secret Hideout face down and set the **Hostage** aside. (It doesn't go back to your Hostage pile.) Similarly, if an effect turns the Secret Hideout face down, set the **Hostage** aside. Once the **Hostage** card is no longer beneath the Secret Hideout it also stops granting its Keyword Power.

It's possible for the same Main Character to have multiple Hostages (one for each Secret Hideout you play while you have that Main Character). 

Note: A **Hostage** is never actually in play. It's either in a Hostage pile, beneath a Secret Hideout, or set aside (after leaving a Secret Hideout).

**Anchor Host**  
Shadow King is technically a supporting character but he doesn’t want to actually be in play. He prefers to have a physical host. If he would appear for any reason, you’ll remove him from the game instead and choose a face-up character on your side to be his Host. If you don’t have a face-up character, Shadow King will still be removed from the game. When his Host gets stunned or leaves play Shadow King will remain removed from the game.

# [She-Hulk](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/aff-003.jpg) (MC)
*Set: A-Force*  

**Rules Lawyer**  
She-Hulk’s main character introduces a new kind of super power called a **Reaction**. It reads: 

> Reaction : When an enemy player uses a super power, you may say “Objection!” If you do, cancel that super power.

Reaction powers trigger when a certain condition is met (in this case it’s “When an enemy player uses a super power”). When that happens you can pay an (and say “Objection” of course) and if you do it cancels the super power so it never takes effect.

You can use a Reaction power at any time, as long as its trigger condition is met. However, like other super powers, you can only use it once per turn.

Q: How does **Rules Lawyer** work timing wise under the rules for effects needing to resolve as soon as they are played?

A: Basically when She-Hulk LV2 is in play, whenever an opponent uses a Super Power, they will need to give the She-Hulk player a chance to respond before resolving the effect.

^(Source: FB Post - Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

---

Q: How does **Rules Lawyer** work if the Super Power needs one choice made from multiple options?

A: If the effect requires a choice, like choosing a character, the She-Hulk player has to make their decision on whether or not to use **Rules Lawyer** before those choices are made.

Q: How does **Rules Lawyer** work on powers like **Nullify** or **Magnetic Supression**?

## [Singularity](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/aff-015.jpg) (SC - AFF-015*)
*Set: A-Force*

Q: What happens if I use Singularity's power to remove my characters, then on my opponent's turn, Singularity is targeted by Cosmo. Do my characters still return at the end of the turn or when singularity is stunned/leaves play?

A: Singularity's power creates a delayed triggered modifier that exists independent of its source. Removing the power from the source does nothing to negate or change the delayed trigger modifier already created. In short, playing Cosmo on Singularity does not stop the previously removed characters from returning.

Q: What happens to the character brought in by Pixie if I want to RFG it with Singularity?

Q: If you Singularity Doc Oc does he draw at the start of your turn?

A: The delayed trigger from Singularity and Genius both trigger "At the start of your turn..."

So you do not draw from Genius brought back with Singularity in the same turn.

Q: Juggernaut attacks Singularity who is in the front row, pays a ![](%%Might%%) (Might) and stuns her. Do the other characters come back in time for Juggernaut to declare his second attack or no?

A:  The controller of Singularity decides which row the characters come back into play. So they could put them in the front row, or the back row. So if they opt to put them all in the front row, it is no dice. If they put at least one in the back row, the next question then becomes, can Juggernaut attack them? And the answer is YES! You see, Singularity triggers upon her leaving play which is during combat resolution, so that is when her power triggers. Juggernaut on the other hand, triggers after combat resolution is over. Since Singularity triggered first, it will resolve first and your opponent could opt to put a character into his back row. IF he does, then it will be there for Juggernaut to attack when his trigger resolves.

# Sister Grimm

Q: The Singularity ruling states that when a character comes back into play it is a new character and nothing has now previously effected it. Can Sister Grimm use a **...Let the Staff of One Emerge** ability she has previously used since technically she's a new character and now has not technically used the previous ability?

A: A once per game restriction is something that functions in all zones, no matter who controls the character or what zone it is in. This means even if a character with a power with a once per game restriction leaves play and comes back, you still can not use it again if it was used before leaving play. Also if an opponent takes control of a character with a one per game restriction, if they use the super power, when you get it back, you will not be able to use that power.

*Set: Spider-Friends*  

**I Can and Will Fight You**
This issue introduces the powerful Alien Symbiote version of Spider-Man. But as they say, with great alien power comes great alien… danger. While the symbiote does make him stronger, he must remove it or it will quickly be game over. In the comics, when Spider-Man fights off the symbiote, it splits off from him as a separate entity. In the game, when Spider-Man sheds the symbiote, it splits off from him as a separate card. When this happens, Spider-Man will become Level 2 and now wears a cloth version of his black costume and the Alien Symbiote will look for a new host. (Note: Spider-Man Level 2 has one less Health – this represents losing the strength of the symbiote.) 

When a character with the Alien Symbiote is turned face down but isn’t KO’d, just keep the equipment token face up and ready, just like when it’s equipped to a face-up character (it doesn’t exhaust or turn face down). And remember, the symbiote is a jealous entity – it can’t be destroyed or removed from its host (at least until the host leaves play).

# \* [Star Lord](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/GAL-006.jpg) \*
*Set: Galactic Guardians*  

Kitty Pryde becomes Star-Lord when the original Star-Lord is otherwise employed. So she has *s around her name, meaning she shares the "mantle" with Star-Lord, himself. The sharing of the mantle means both characters can be on a side at the same time because they're different beings, just with the same name. So you don't KO either because of the uniqueness rules and they can't power each other up.

Note that although this card represents her joining the Guardians of the Galaxy she's still an X-Men at heart, so she has both team affiliations.

Her **Intangibility** power lets her strike characters while they're in a player's hand. This is uncanny. A couple things about this: 

* She can strike any number of 0 DEF characters (or characters with * DEF).  
* She can strike characters who normally couldn't be struck by her while on a side (like Bulletproof characters) because those powers aren't active while the character is in a hand.  
* It doesn't matter how much (Health) a struck character has, it gets discarded.

Q: 

* My 1/10 Mystique MC is attacking Baron Von Strucker who is a 6/2. I play Masquerade, and match his power.  
* 6/10 Mystique attacking 6/3 Baron. I've played her super power and pass.  
* Baron plays Strength Above All Else. At this moment we match so he has highest attack and can't be struck this combat.  
* Priority back to me, I play Cat Fight to raise my attack to 10/10.  
  
Does Strength Above All Else still prevent the damage? Did it just grant protection when it resolves, or does it check for ATK again at strike?

A: if you are the highest ATK character during combat resolution you can't be struck

>Supreme Leader's effect will prevent you from losing the game and will also prevent other players from winning the game

Supreme Leader MC is worded in a way that may make veterans of other card games such as Magic the Gathering believe that a card like [Dutch SC](https://i.imgur.com/N3EzGfJ.jpg) or [Deadpool MC](https://i.imgur.com/3Qt4DfF.png) may still allow an alternate win condition.  After all, in MtG a player being unable to lose doesn't prevent another player from winning as they are isolated effects.  In VS 2PCG this is considered an extension of the "can't beats can" rule.  By that logic, alternate win conditions are ignored as long as Supreme Leader is preventing its controller from losing the game.

# [Taskmaster](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/LEG-051.jpg)
*Set: Legacy*

Q: What happens if I recruit Taskmaster while my opponent has Onslaught in play?

A: So Onslaught's Power happens at the time you recruit him (faster than appears powers).  
  
Taskmaster comes into play, but doesn't have Onslaught's power when he's recruited, so nothing happens.  
  
As far as the power's that Onslaught has, Taskmaster doesn't copy those because they aren't Printed Powers like Taskmaster is looking for.  
  
So Onslaught is effectively doing nothing for Taskmaster.

> Keyword abilities are only in effect while the character card is in play unless otherwise specified.

Previous to [Taskmaster's](https://i.imgur.com/85KjJHT.jpg) release, keyword abilities were active in all zones.  This allowed cards such as [Hope Summers](https://i.imgur.com/R2iOAee.png) to use their powers from the hand, deck or KO pile.  With the release of Taskmaster, this rule became limiting on design of future cards and was changed.  (For example, Taskmaster was able to be recruited from the deck with [Spider-Gwen's](https://i.imgur.com/ZkdbqZ0.png) Dimensional Watch keyword if your opponent had her in play.)

>A copied power can't copy a power with the same name as itself.

An infinite loop was discovered when [Taskmaster](https://i.imgur.com/85KjJHT.jpg) was across from an opposing Taskmaster where they would gain a copy of, then continuously copy the printed version of their opponent's Photgraphic Reflexes.  With this additional rule, this scenario would result in Taskmaster gaining two instances of all keyword powers for face-up enemy supporting characters, but the loop would not continue beyond two instances.

Q: Scenario: I have Taskmaster on my side and my opponent plays H.A.M.M.E.R. Cloak. Is Cloak hit with -1/-1 counters from Taskmaster copying **Darkforce Channeling**?

A: Yes. Powers are active before the character appears (see official rules). Taskmaster is therefore able to copy this power and when Cloak appears he gets hit with Taskmaster's copy of **Darkforce Channeling**.

This issue adds a new Level 2 and Level 3 Thanos to the MCU. Now when your Level 1 Thanos levels up with **Fine. I'll Do It Myself.** you can choose which Level 2 version he becomes. If you choose the new version, he can now level up a second time to his level 3.

At Level 3, when it's time to **Bring Balance to the Universe**, you must reveal the six Marvel Locations (they have the Marvel logo at the bottom) and snap. Then count all of the characters on all sides and KO half of them. (If there's an odd number, KO one more than half.)

You choose which characters to KO. If you want to win the game, we recommend KOing each enemy Main Character, but it's up to you.

Q: If I use Professor X to take my opponent's level 2 Thanos, and I use **Infinity Gauntlet**, does Thanos get stunned?

^(Source: Chad Daniel - UDE Approved)

## [Thanos](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/BLK-005.jpg) (MC)
*Set: Black Order*  

At Level 1, if Thanos gets KO'd by getting stunned, **Resurrected by Death Herself** will cause him to gain an XP and become Level 2 while in the stunned position. (If a power like Hex prevents him from leveling up, he'll remain at Level 1 but still heal his wounds.)

**Schemes and Dreams**  prevents you from drawing cards during your Draw Phase, including your normal draws plus effects like Genius. However, if Thanos is face down at the start of your turn, Schemes and Dreams will be turned off. This means you can draw cards during your Draw Phase, however you can't search for a card.

**My Quest Begins** counts each card that enters your hand from your deck. So if you draw three cards, that would be 3 XP.
  
**The Universe Will Now Be Set Right**  has a 50-50 chance of removing each character on each side from the game. If this removes a players last main character, that player ;oses the game. If this removes each player's last main character (including Thanos, himself) then the Thanos player wins the game. (This is similar to how if the final two main characters KO each other in combat, the player whose turn it was wins.)

# [Thor](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/mcu1-009.jpg) (MC)
*Set: The MCU Battles*  

Thor’s **Journey of Self Discovery** Level Up power requires him to make three separate attacks in the order printed on his card to gain an XP. These attacks don’t have to be in a row. For example, he could make a solo attack, then a team attack with one teammate, then another solo attack, and finally when he team attacks with exactly two other characters he’ll gain an XP.

# \* [Thor](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/COS-011.jpg) \*
*Set: Cosmic Avengers*  

Jane Foster becomes Thor when the original Thor shirks his responsibility. She has \*s around her name, meaning she shares the "mantle" with Thor himself. This means both characters can be on a side at the same time because they're different beings, just with the same name. So you don't KO either because of uniqueness rules and they can't power each other up. When Thor is ready to start being "the" Thor again, Jane gracefully demurs. 

To represent this, her **There Must Always Be a Thor** power can only search for a card named "Thor" (with no \*s ) or with **AKA Thor** (like Odinson). It can't get a copy of herself. 

Jane's **A God Who Knows How Precious Life Is** is not a super power.

Ultron is really six main characters in one: three identical Level 1s, two identical Level 2s, and one Level 3. Before the game starts you’ll put one Level 1 Ultron onto your side. The remaining five Ultron cards will start out of play in a face-up pile called your **Ultron Facility**. 

During the game you can use any Ultron’s **There’s Only One Path To Peace** power to put the lowest level Ultron from your Ultron Facility onto your side. When one of your Ultron main 27 characters gets KO’d it goes back to your Ultron Facility where it will be available to be brought back again.

If all your Ultrons are in the Ultron Facility at the same time, you lose the game.

When you use **Wizard Armor,** ignore everything about the plot twist you’re holding and play it entirely as an Open Fire, Find Cover, etc.

If the plot twist has a play restriction you can’t meet (for example a team affiliation symbol you don’t have on your side) it doesn’t matter.

Similarly, if a Plot Twist has a play benefit (like Death Trap) you don’t get to make use of it.

The Wizard Main Character is found in the Vs. System 2PCG: The Fantastic Battles set.

*Set: The Marvel Battles*

Q: If Wolverine team attacks with one other character, but in the middle of combat the other character gets stunned by a Plot Twist or Super Power, and then Wolverine stuns the defender, will Wolverine get an XP because now it ended up being a solo attack?

A: Yes, because it only checks if it was a solo attack during combat resolution.

Q: If Wolverine is stunned as an enemy character is stunned as the result of striking each other, will Wolverine get an XP?

A: Yes.

Q: Scenario: Wolverine level 2 has 4 wounds and 1 XP. He attacks and trades with a defender. Question: Does wolverine take his 5th wound and get KO'd or can he get the XP and level up first (gaining a 6th health).

A: There is a difference between a stunned Wolverine leveling up while stunned and a stunned Wolverine leveling up before he is KO'ed. While technically the level-up power will trigger, by the time it resolves, Wolverine is already KO'ed.

*Set: Power & Reality*  

**Guardian of These Books** will trigger when you use an ![](%%Intellect%%) (Intellect) Super Power, even if you don't actually spend an ![](%%Intellect%%) (Intellect). For example, Bruce Banner's **I Think I'm Getting The Hang of It!** is an ![](%%Intellect%%) (Intellect) and ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy) Super Power and will trigger **Guardian of These Books** even if Bruce spends an ![](%%Energy%%) (Energy) to use it (and even if he spends nothing because Iron Man is on your side!).

# The Wrecker
*Set: Masters of Evil*

See [The Wrecking Crew](#wiki_the_wrecking_crew)

# The Wrecking Crew
*Set: Masters of Evil*

Three **Wrecking Crew** members can each attack a different part of the game, and the Wrecker can attack any one of the three each time he attacks. (They can also make normal attacks.) Here's how it works:

These are all melee attacks so in order to make them, the **Wrecking Crew** member must be ready and in his front row, and he will exhaust to start the combat.

The **Wrecking Crew** character can attack an enemy player’s resource row/hand/deck even if that player has any face-up characters on their sides. In other words, characters can’t “protect” a resource row, hand, or deck from the **Wrecking Crew**.

While a member of the Wrecking Crew is attacking a hand, deck, or resource row, he counts as being an attacker, but there is no defending character. (The opponent still counts as the “defending player” though.) Players can play Plot Twists, use Super Powers, or Power Up as normal. For example, the defending player could play a Plot Twist to reduce the attacker’s ATK or cancel the combat.

These special attacks can be team attacks as long as each character in the attack is allowed to attack that special part of the game. For example, Piledriver and the Wrecker could team attack an enemy hand. In this case, their effects will resolve in the order the attacking player chooses. So you could have the Piledriver make the opponent discard and then draw cards, and then after that the Wrecker would do the same (or vice versa).

# [Wyatt Wingfoot](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/FAN-014.jpg)
*Set: The Fantastic Battles*  

**Self-Awareness**  
Wyatt knows he is in a  **Card Game**, and he wants to play too! So when he appears, and until he leaves play, he gets his own hand and resource row.  **Note:** His hand counts as being part of your hand, and his resource row counts as being part of your resource row.

Here’s how it works:

*   At the end of your Draw Phase, Wyatt draws two cards into his part of your hand. (Keep these cards separate from the main part of your hand.)  
    *   **This is the only way to add cards to his part of your hand**. If another effect would add cards to your hand, they always go to the main part of your hand, never to Wyatt’s part of your hand.  
    *  All other effects that affect your hand work as normal.  
        *   For example, if you are forced to ”discard a random card”, you must randomize all the cards in your hand, including Wyatt’s part of your hand.  
* At the end of your Resource Step, Wyatt may play a resource from his hand into his part of your resource row. (Keep these resources separate from the main part of your resource row.)
    *   **This is the only way to add resources to his part of your resource row**. If another effect would add resources to your resource row, they always go to the main part of your resource row, never to Wyatt’s part of your resource row.  
* At the end of your Recruit Step (after you’ve spent your normal Recruit Points to play cards from the main part of your hand, and any leftover Recruit Points go away), you gain 1 Recruit Point for each resource in Wyatt’s part of the resource row. You can only spend these Recruit Points to play cards from Wyatt’s part of your hand.  
* Characters and Equipment you play from Wyatt’s part of the hand work as normal once they are on your side. (Once they’re in play, it doesn’t matter if they came from your main hand or Wyatt’s part of your hand.)  
* You can play Plot Twists or power-ups from Wyatt’s part of your hand as normal.  
* You can spend Locations in Wyatt’s part of your resource row or discard them from Wyatt’s hand to generate power symbols normally.  
* When Wyatt leaves play, remove the cards in his part of your hand and resource row from the game. (Characters and Equipment played from his part of your hand stay in play.)

**Note:** If Wyatt gets moved to another player’s side, remove all the cards in his part of your hand and resource row from the game. Now Wyatt will draw extra cards and play extra resources for that player.

# [X-23](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/NEW-006.jpg) (MC)
*Set: New Mutants*  

X-23 is one of the toughest mutants around. So tough in fact that she only has a Level 1 main character. She can’t level up and she doesn’t care.

# [Xander](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/TBB-015.jpg) (SC) 
*Set: The Buffy Battles*  

When Xander hides, turn him face down but in the ready orientation. Remove all +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters and Equipment from him. A hidden character doesn’t count as being stunned, but it still can’t attack or defend, it doesn’t protect anyone behind it, and loses its powers. It still keeps its other information like name and team affiliation. If a hidden character gets stunned somehow, change it to the stunned orientation (face down and exhausted). A hidden character will turn face up the same time your stunned characters would recover.

# [The X-Files](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/XFB-021.jpg)
*Set: The X-Files Battles*

This Location is the only way to generate an Earth power symbol for a Bureau character. There are currently no basic Earth Locations in the Photographic Universe.

# [Yondu](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MCU6-011.jpg)
*Set: Space & Time*  

In the films, these characters (Talos and Yondu) are sometimes "Good" and sometimes "Evil". In the game, you get to choose.

**Note:** They don't have any team affiliations until you recruit them. If they appear on your side some other way, they won't have a team.

# [You're the Last One](http://vs.tcgbrowser.com/images/cards/big/MCU4-028.jpg)
*Set: Power & Reality*  

When this Plot Twist resolves, it cancels the combat. It then acts as though the player whose turn it is just said, "Okay, I'm done with my turn." And then, anything that triggers "At the end of the turn" will trigger, and the rest of the end-of-turn procedure will happen normally.
