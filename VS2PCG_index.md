## **Notice**

[***VS 2PCG Collective***](https://www.facebook.com/groups/860168987351982/)  Is the primary residence of the VS 2PCG community.  99.9% of all VS 2PCG news and information comes out of or flows through the Collective.  Membership and activity there dwarfs this subreddit but I try to keep all information here as up to date as possible so a Facebook account is never a  prerequisite for playing this amazing game.  There is also a [VS Discussion Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/MsSCTdq) out there.  Check the [Communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/community) page for more VS groups to find players near you.

## **Introduction**

VS System 2PCG is a redesign of the original VS System.  For a history lesson on the original game, click [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/VS2PCG/wiki/history)

In 2PCG, each player starts with a main character in play such as Spider-Man or Green Goblin. During the game you’ll play resources and recruit supporting characters, like Medusa, Ant Man, and Rhino. You’ll organize your formation between your front and back rows, and you’ll make solo and team attacks against your enemies in order to stun and KO them. You’ll play Plot Twists to enhance your team or hurt your opponent’s. You’ll use your Locations to activate your team’s Super Powers. Your main character will earn experience points and level up to dominate the battlefield. Finally, you’ll KO your opponent’s Main Character (or they’ll KO yours).

### **Split Universe**

The cards in VS 2PCG are split into two separate "universes".  Cards with illustrated comic book artwork are part of the Illustrated Universe.  Cards where screencaps and photographs are used in place of artwork are part of the "Photographic Universe."  When building decks, they much contain collections of exactly 60 cards from a single one of the universes with no crossover, but an illustrated deck and a photographic deck can still play against each other normally.

### **Featured Formats**

In addition to the Split Universe model, the designers institute Featured Formats to modify the legal sets for a three month period.  The designers have said they never intend to rotate out an old set entirely.  Only to try different formats to shift the meta on a regular basis.

## **Online Play**

Online play is generally done using Skype or some other video chat application[.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=918650085 "Online Play")  Digital recreation of the VS System 2PCG cards is discouraged by Upper Deck as they are only licensed to use Marvel images and do not own them[.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=918650085 "Online Play")  In the interest of keeping the game going, we do not condone digital recreation of the cards[.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=918650085 "Online Play")  Feel free to contact a mod (like u/LogicBalm) privately for more details or just to play a game or two[.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=918650085 "Online Play")[.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=918650085 "Online Play")[.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=918650085 "Online Play")  Don't forget about the [Collective](https://www.facebook.com/groups/860168987351982/) and the [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/MsSCTdq).  Between those two communities and this sub, finding someone to play over Skype is rarely difficult, just requires some coordination.

## **Upper Deck Quality Assurance**

Email qa@upperdeck.com if you buy a box that you discover is missing any cards.  Include exactly which product you purchased, what you're missing and shipping information.

### Known QA Issues

* The Marvel Battles base set has some printing issues that appear as white specs on the borders of the cards.  Later reprints of the base set corrected this.  These quality control issues came about as a result of their printer vendor and caused delays in some subsequent sets due to the increased quality assurance challenges to correct the problem.

* Reprints of two misprinted cards from the Predator set can be [ordered from UDE here.](http://upperdeckblog.com/2018/01/vs-system-2pcg-the-predator-battles-card-replacement-redemption/)  See the linked article for details.

* The X-Files Battles set released in November 2020 had some quality control issues regarding miscut cards and card stock quality.  Reach out to qa@upperdeck.com as they have assisted players in the past with getting this corrected.

* In the Friendly Neighborhood set, released in March 2020, the L1 Main Character [Mysterio card was misprinted](https://www.upperdeckblog.com/2020/03/vs-system-2pcg-friendly-neighborhood-card-preview-mysterious/?fbclid=IwAR0Fuo-OuTRNMy2Urd5l-wLPZtrnAg4Nsx70IBAonWCNN72WcPEgBMUvWlA).
